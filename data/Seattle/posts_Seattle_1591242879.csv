The Seattle Police Department (henceforth referred to as the SPD) has body-cams that record constantly but only save the data when activated. There is allegedly a one minute buffer that is stored when the camera activates. That is to say, when an officer enables his/her camera, the minute prior to the activation is saved as well as every moment afterward until it is again deactivated. The mayor has mentioned this in several of her press conferences, but I cannot find a source for this minute timer anywhere on the [website](https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/body-worn-video).

It got me curious as to why there was simply a one minute buffer instead of something more substantial. One minute hardly seems enough time to capture all the nuance leading up to a circumstance that would provoke a cop to activate the camera. What if instead it were an hour of footage? How much would that cost the taxpayers to implement?

I purchased a dashcam a while back, and one of the things noted on the [page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HMZVYLY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) is that 64gb of storage on an SD card is good to hold up to 7 hours of footage. This lead me to search for more sources ([1,](https://filecatalyst.com/how-to-move-large-video-files/) [2,](https://www2.yitechnology.com/support/answer/id/59/tid/3/qid/10/oid/a2) [3](https://toolstud.io/video/filesize.php?dimensions_w=2560&amp;dimensions_h=1440&amp;framerate=60&amp;timeduration=60&amp;timeduration_unit=minutes)) to confirm this value, and while it does seem a bit high, it doesn't seem impossible. The number I've seen most frequently is about 7gb per hour at a resolution of 2560x1440p and a framerate of 120-144hz. For those who don't know much about resolutions and framerates, those are both likely higher than what the dashcams record. The point of this post is to get a higher estimate for storage to see what the ""worst case"" scenario would be.

Running with the 7gb/hr estimate, I then made some bold leaps in logic. I assumed that each cop would wear 2 body cams; one on their helmet, and another on their vest. This effectively doubles our required storage space from 7gb/hr to 14. I know that not all (and in fact likely few) cops wear two sets of body cameras, but I'll refer you back again to my comment about ""worst case"". 

Now I had to find out how many cops were currently employed by the SPD to get a high-end estimate of how many potential officers could be simultaneously wearing two body cameras and recording. According to this [link](https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-the-department/department-fact-sheet) from the Seattle government, there are presently 1444 ""sworn officers"" under the payroll of the SPD. Let's round that up to 1500 for the purposes of clean numbers.

7gb/hr * 2 bodycams per officer * 1500 officers =  21000 gigabytes of storage necessary. That may sound like a lot (and it kinda is to an individual), but it is a relatively paltry amount realistically. I actually have almost as much storage on my home computer, and I'm simply an idiot with a penchant for buying computer parts because they are on sale.

This brings me to my final set of sources. My goal was to estimate how much it would cost, not how much space would be needed. Referring back to the first [source](https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/body-worn-video#howarethevideosstored) tells me that the current videos are stored with Microsoft Azure Government Cloud. Don't worry; I hadn't heard of it either. I had previously done quite a lot of work trekking through various online storage sites to figure out a decent guess for $/gb, but thankfully Microsoft has this information readily available on their [site](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/). Unfortunately, I do not know what the SPD currently pays for from Microsoft, so the numbers here will be guesses based on what information is available.

There are a few potential options available. As you can see from the previous source, as well as this final [source](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?service=storage), the pricing ranges from 0.00081$/gb (no typo) to 0.058$/gb, as well as options for purchasing only as much storage as needed or larger packages. Let's do some more math!

* 0.00081$/gb * 21000gb = 17.01$ per month, or 204.12$ per year. I'd be willing to front that cost personally if it meant fewer brutality cases.

* 0.058$/gb * 21000gb = 1218.00$ per month, or 14616$ per year. This number is closest in line with what I had found for other cloud storage services, but let's assume that it's somehow not the right package.

* The final calculator option allows me to choose specifically 21000gb of storage on a ""pay-as-you-go"" plan. The monthly cost ends up being 436.80$, or 5341.60$ per year. This turns out to be about 0.0208$/gb, or somewhere between the two options previously discussed. I'm not sure what the differences are, but I suppose it doesn't matter overly much.

So the end result is that it would cost somewhere in the range of 5000-15000$ per year to fully fund the server space necessary to have an entire hour of high-quality footage saved whenever the cops activate their body cameras. 

Let me address a few potential concerns that I expect to hear.

1.  *""But this doesn't count the cost/space needed to store videos after they are recorded! It only counts how much would be required to save one hour from each camera!""*

 This is true. It does not factor in the cost of storing footage after it has been recorded. The point of this example was to demonstrate that it is an affordable endeavor to dedicate this storage space to the disastrous scenario where literally every single cop in the SPD activates both body cameras simultaneously.

2. *""What about the fact that the cameras keep recording after they are activated? This only accounts for the hour leading up to the event and says nothing about what happens afterwards!""*

 Again, another true concern. The data would need to be able to fit both the hour leading up to the event as well as the subsequent activities after activation. However, the SPD should ideally not be storing their passively recorded footage in the same servers as the activated footage that needs to be reviewed after an incident. 

3. *""Cops already have too much information on citizens. You want to give them greater access to unrestricted surveillance?""*

 I think this is a separate issue entirely. My main concern is that 1 minute is an insufficient amount of time to fully encapsulate the scenario that lead up to the police feeling as though the event needed to be recorded. Whether you think 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 30 minutes or more is the right number is largely irrelevant. This was merely a thought experiment of sorts to prove that more can (and should) be done.

4. *""It's too expensive. I don't want to pay for the police to have an hour+ of footage to review for every traffic stop.""*

 I think the numbers speak for themselves in terms of affordability, but I invite you to consider the fact that the SPD [budgeted](http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/New-Seattle-Police-Department-Patrol-Vehicles-Overview.pdf) 48,000$ per patrol car to purchase new vehicles in 2014. Moreover, the annual cost to maintain these vehicles for their alarmingly short life span (~30 months) comes out to around [11,000$](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?.date=19910730&amp;slug=1297195). Again, these values are per video. If you think that the SPD is in dire need of every single one of their vehicles but not in need of functioning bodycams that can capture the circumstances around a potentially fatal incident, I'd say your priorities are misplaced. 

I hadn't initially intended for this to be such a long post, but I feel as though a point could be made here. More accountability is clearly needed, and I see a path forward that is both reasonably simple and surprisingly affordable.

### Seattle mayor lifts curfew order

Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best on Wednesday evening rescinded the city's daily curfew, which had been in effect since Saturday night.

""Earlier today (Best) and I met with community leaders who asked us to end the curfew,"" Durkan tweeted just after 7 p.m. ""Chief Best believes we can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew.""

""For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate,"" she continued. ""We want you to continue making your voice heard.""

What will it take for you to stop protesting?  When will you say ""Yay, we won, I can go home now.""

The protests so far have been have been mainly an outpouring of rage and emotion.  Reminds me of a temper tantrum children throw.  There hasn't really been a solid request except ""stop killing people"".  As such I'm not sure what you want, and how to make you happy.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying protesting doesn't have a place.  Protesting can be very useful.  It can actually be seen as a miniature War.

What is War?  War is the use of force to achieve political results.  Well, you've got the force; you are a force to be reckoned with.  But what are the political results you desire?  Be specific.

All four officers involved in the murder of George Floyd were fired, and have been charged as follows:  
**Derek Chauvin** - charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, has an additional charge of second-degree murder   
**Thomas Lang** - charged with second-degree aiding and abetting felony murder and second-degree aiding and abetting manslaughter  
**J.A. Kueng**  - charged with second-degree aiding and abetting felony murder and second-degree aiding and abetting manslaughter  
**Tou Thao** - charged with second-degree aiding and abetting felony murder and second-degree aiding and abetting manslaughter  

Is this enough?

Do you require the Qualified Immunity law to be overturned and removed?  Will that be enough?  

In Washington State it is (was?) basically impossible to charge a police officer with murder, as you had to show Malice.  SB 7053 was introduced in 2017 to address that, but I don't know what came of it.    https://projects.seattletimes.com/2015/killed-by-police/   If it was easier to charge officers with murder, would that be enough?  

In Washington, the Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the Governor.  They control all of Seattle.  If you want changes to the law made, pressure them to make the changes.  But what changes do you want made?  Go find the RCW you want changed.  What changes do you want made to it?  BE SPECIFIC.  The country isn't governed by riots, protests, and terrorism.  This county is governed by laws.  

The only way to make change, is to change the law.

Actually, it could be solved quicker than that.  The Chief just has to order officers (immediately) to wear the black band just above/below their badge number, and if they prefer, buy a custom badge that accomplishes the same thing, for future use: https://www.seattlepolicefoundation.org/mourning-badge

That's what *real* leadership would do.  **Solve** the problem, ASAP.  This is such an easy problem to solve, but Durkan has been dragging it out for days, milking it, and in so doing, avoiding addressing other issues that are more core to the problem of abuse.  Chief Best isn't much better on the issue, being mostly silent.

This is such an obvious failure of leadership.  ""Can't be solved overnight"".  Give me an effing break.  It could be solved in an afternoon.  It just takes the will to do it.

I fall into this group and want to do more than donating and calling politicians so I’ve been brainstorming other ways to help. 

The best I’ve come up with so far (I think) is trying to organize a city-wide neighborhood sit in. Everyone would block the roads in front of their houses (or a neighborhood of their choosing) and essentially shut-down the city. This could run in parallel to the existing protests and give people who need it a well deserved break while still allowing others who can’t attend the primary rallies a chance to physically show their support via a socially distanced protest. 

Is this something people would be interested in and see as worth supporting? I’m not much of a graphic designer but tossed together a basic poster if we get enough support. Also all ears for other ideas along these lines.

The words “Equal Justice Under Law” are carved in the pediment of the United States Supreme Court. This is precisely what protesters are rightly demanding. It is a wholesome and unifying demand—one that all of us should be able to get behind. We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values—our values as people and our values as a nation. When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside. We must reject any thinking of our cities as a “battlespace” that our uniformed military is called upon to “dominate.” At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors. Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict—a false conflict—between the military and civilian society. It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part. Keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them. James Madison wrote in Federalist 14 that “America united with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat.” We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose. And it starts by guaranteeing that all of us are equal before the law. Instructions given by the military departments to our troops before the Normandy invasion reminded soldiers that “The Nazi slogan for destroying us…was ‘Divide and Conquer.’ Our American answer is ‘In Union there is Strength.’” We must summon that unity to surmount this crisis—confident that we are better than our politics. Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children. We can come through this trying time stronger, and with a renewed sense of purpose and respect for one another. The pandemic has shown us that it is not only our troops who are willing to offer the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of the community. Americans in hospitals, grocery stores, post offices, and elsewhere have put their lives on the line in order to serve their fellow citizens and their country. We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution. At the same time, we must remember Lincoln’s “better angels,” and listen to them, as we work to unite. Only by adopting a new path—which means, in truth, returning to the original path of our founding ideals—will we again be a country admired and respected at home and abroad.

I am doing my best to summarize what Inslee says in his own words. There was quite a lot to get through in this conference so I had to type fast, apologies for misspellings or if I missed something. 

* Attempts by protest leaders to keep the protests peaceful and prevent ""hijacking"" are working
* Pierce County investigating March 3 death of Manuel Ellis - top priority of Inslee to have a full and complete investigation, he does not yet have additional information to share and can't render judgment without that investigation. Criminal prosecution not off the table if necessary. Independent investigation (mandated by Initiative 940) will be very helpful. Inslee completely understands that this death will engender a very strong response, hopes it can be funneled in a productive way that bring about a more equitable society. 
* About State Patrol language - investigation is under full review - officers in these situations have tough jobs, water bottles thrown at them, now lasers are being shined to damage their eyesight, but high standards are still expected of them.
* ""We have a moment of potential positive change"" - and understanding why we need the change is just as important as figuring out how - Inslee says that he himself has been on a lifelong learning process of learning about ingrained racism.
* Beyond police or law enforcement reform, we need economic justice, housing, food security, truly equal access to education and healthcare
* Inslee will be electronically meeting with Not This Time, Urban League, Black Lives Matter King County later today.
* National Guard has been activated as a ""prudent step"" to respond to community needs - but the Guard is ""our neighbors"" and come from our communities. They have also stepped up to assist with contact tracing, food banks.
* 21% of Washington citizens visited a food bank in April - up from 12% usually. More money being released to assist with this.
* COVID risk assessment dashboard (accessible through coronavirus.wa.gov) has been updated today with county-specific investigation.
* Every county is either in phase 2 or applying to move forward - eight counties are expected to be eligible to move to phase 3.
* No county needs to meet every single goal set by the state in order to advance.
* Adequate testing, contact tracing, isolation, use of masks is vital for any county's application to be considered.
* Twelve applications have been sent in (six to move to phase 2 and six to phase 3), will be reviewed over the Department of Health over the next several days. Will be done as quickly as possible without rubber-stamping applications.
* Industry-specific phase 3 guidelines must be in place before any county can advance.
* Questions from press:
* Has police's response been proportionate? Tens of thousands of interactions total between citizens and police. Inslee has seen some troublesome incidents and calls for a full investigation of those under the existing protocols. Law enforcement works in very tense and difficult situations, we have high expectations and they have been mostly fulfilled. Inslee commends the protest organizers for not allowing violence to overwhelm their peaceful protests or obscure their very legitimate demands. Will defer Seattle-specific questions to the mayor.
* Addressing policing issues during legislature special session? It will be discussed, first step is listening to people's ideas, not rushing in with governor's or legislature's pre-packaged ideas. The vote for Initiative 940 that was passed overwhelmingly by the people requires a robust and independent investigation (although it needs to be applied in every circumstance, doing it rather than just saying it). Washington de-escalation training is a national model. But training does not remove ingrained racial attitudes.
* Why no concern about social distancing with the protests, after three months of making people stay home? First Amendment right to protest has been respected, regardless of political ideology of protesters. Protests in Olympia several weeks ago were treated no differently by police than protests today. Inslee hopes that masks and six feet of distance will continue in all aspects of daily life, 90% of protesters wearing masks so far. Hopes that people remain committed to both justice and COVID avoidance.
* Should legislature special session be convened this month, before new fiscal year? No plan yet exists that would have the votes to pass. Discussions among legislatures are continuing. No point in convening special session unless it would be guaranteed to be productive. ""Absolutely everything is on the table right now.""
* Claims that cops are instigating violence directly? Justice and peace will not succeed if this is viewed as a ""team sport"" with two entrenched sides. We should view justice as a mutual goal. Cops want to go home and not get hurt as well. Encourages people to remain focused on their goals and what they truly want to achieve.
* People have been coming out with guns to protect their property, Inslee response was to say ""trust the police to protect you,"" would he say the same to Black citizens? Yes. Firearms just add to the volatility of the situation.
* Does Inslee support tear gas and flashbangs? Defers to law enforcement, with so many potential situations that could arise, it may be necessary in some situations and never necessary in some others. Encourages law enforcement to think and consider before deploying any such measure.
* Concerns about trust being ruptured? Yes, Initiative 940 will not resolve all problems but will hopefully ensure that no one, including law enforcement, is beyond the law.
* Listening to each other and being motivated by compassion, thinking with our heads rather than knee-jerk reactions, will bring about positive change.",False,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,210548,public,self,Summary of Inslee's June 3 press conference: COVID-19 and protests,0,[],0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/gw4jn6/summary_of_inslees_june_3_press_conference/,all_ads,6,flair,News,,,,,,9f9ba910-f804-11e4-be5c-0ea18645ab5f,,,,,,,,,,,,

Senator Pedersen got back to me yesterday - and here's the e-mail conversation that I've had.

------------------------------------

Dear Senator Pedersen,

I've had a chance to call your office, and to speak to your aide - and he suggested that I could e-mail you.

I'm incredibly concerned by ongoing violence in my community. Yesterday, just a few blocks from where I live, a peaceful gathering of my neighbours was attached by police with pepper spray, batons, tear gas, and flashbang grenades. My neighbours were crying and vomiting, many of them temporarily blinded, and chemically burned. As seen in multiple videos, the police started this attack, unprovoked.

This is completely unacceptable, as is the absentee, one-sided handling of the situation by Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan. Despite her numerous verbal assurances, I have zero confidence that the Seattle Office of Police Accountability will conduct an impartial investigation, or that any of the police officers involved will be brought to justice.

I understand that the primary responsibility over this lies with the Mayor's office, but I also understand that the state senate has the ability to positively influence this situation.

The Seattle Police Department needs to be brought under control. It is a danger to Seattle's public, and Seattle's businesses. The department's job is to protect the public, not attack it. I ask that you push for real accountability from the Mayor, and the city police, for impartial, civilian state oversight of the department, for the instigators of this assault to be held fully responsible, to the fullest extent of the law. If the fullest extent of the law permits this sort of behaviour, I ask that you work on changing the law - because this kind of violence has no place in America.

Thank you,

to me

Dear [Name] --

Thank you for your message.  I have been heartsick at the senseless killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Aubrey and the sense that we have made so little progress as a country combatting centuries of systemic racism.  With the president fanning the flames of hatred and division, I initially took comfort in the idea that our Washington had done good work over the last several years to ensure that such incidents would be less likely here.  That included the passage of Initiative 940 in 2018 (https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/initiative-940-modifying-law-regulating-police-use-of-deadly-force-holds-strong-lead-in-tuesdays-returns/) and a bipartisan bill in the 2019 session to make broadly agreed on changes to the initiative (https://apnews.com/fed93021fe1e4c27adc87f80b855b4cb). 

Since last Friday, I have therefore watched with grave disappointment how officers from the Seattle Police Department have responded to what have largely been peaceful protests near my home on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in Seattle.  I am deeply troubled both by the aggressive and militarized response to these protests, including liberal use of tear gas and flash bombs and the use of pepper spray on a young child, and by the contrast between that response and the police response to armed and largely white crowds protesting Governor Inslee's Stay Home, Stay Healthy order. 

I am sorry that it has taken me so long to appreciate the scale of this problem, but as chair of the Senate Law &amp; Justice Committee, I am committed to doing my best to addressing it.  The legislature adjourned for the year on March 12 and is not scheduled to reconvene until January 2021.  But in the interim, I have asked my committee staff to work on the following ideas for potential legislation in the 2021 session:

1. Prohibiting the use of chokeholds. 

2. Prohibiting law enforcement agencies in our state from accepting surplus military equipment.

3. Requiring the use of body cameras statewide.

4. Prohibiting law enforcement officers from covering their badge numbers while on duty.

5. Requiring state collection of data on police use of force.

6. Strengthening de-escalation and anti-bias training for law enforcement officers.

Over the next few months, I will also be listening to communities of color, constituents, and other stakeholders and to their suggestions for change in our law enforcement culture and doing my best to advance all worthy ideas for change.  I welcome any specific suggestions that you may have.

Best wishes, Jamie

Thank you for your efforts. I am sure that they will move the needle forward on better legislature for this.

It has gotten much worse since yesterday. People are getting gassed in their own apartments, because there are walls of tear gas rolling through the neighborhood - the upper stories of these buildings are all residential. They are being forced out of their own living rooms and bedrooms, with nowhere to go, between the gas, and the curfew, and the police.

This is completely out of control. The department's gas needs to be taken away from it, immediately. It is completely incapable of using it in a restrained manner. There must be *something* the state can do to stop this.

How can anyone support this? This made me absolutely sick last night.

This is a portion of the 6/2/20 protest in Seattle. I have no political opinion and no agenda. I watched this protest for hours and I now have a considerable amount of respect for the national guard. They stood between the police and the protesters, even when the police pepper sprayed over their shoulders, and when specific people among the protesters tried to incite violence.

In the end, the violent police and the violent protesters got what they wanted.

Regardless of whether you support police or not, the threat of pain is not acceptable. If you are in the wrong place at the wrong time you can suffer life long lasting injuries.

Westley from princess bride, suggested not to the death, but to the pain. More terrifying than anything the king could think of.

These words and this person do not have to be representative of the police force and I think we can all agree this is too far.

This man wants to hurt us, he does not want the protests to stop.
