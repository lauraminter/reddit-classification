As expected, Seattleites paid significantly more for their Mountain Dews and Monster Energy Drinks last year. They also paid much more for diet drinks in some stores, even though non-sugary beverages were exempt from the city’s new tax.

📷

Researchers at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County (PHSKC) found the cost of Seattle’s so-called soda tax was almost entirely passed on to consumers.

The tax – which charges distributors of sweetened beverages 1.75 cents per ounce – took effect Jan. 1, 2018. Six months later, researchers found the average price of sugary drinks in Seattle was 1.70 cents an ounce higher – amounting to a 97 percent pass-through rate. A typical two-liter bottle of soda jumped from $1.80 to $2.95, or 64 percent. A 12-pack of sweetened drinks went from $3.15 to $5.59, or 77 percent more.

The aim of the tax is to discourage consumption of sugary drinks, which can lead to diabetes and other health risks, while also raising revenue to improve access to healthy food and to fund other nutrition and early learning programs.

“Although we weren’t surprised, it wasn’t guaranteed the tax would be passed on,” said Jessica Jones-Smith, associate professor of health services and epidemiology at the UW School of Public Health. “Distributors could have chosen to have paid the tax themselves, and take it out of their profits. Or they could have spread the cost across other items.”

Jones-Smith is co-leading a wide-ranging study of the effects of the tax along with Nadine Chan, assistant chief of assessment, policy development and evaluation for PHSKC. The research is funded with revenues from the soda tax. The [six-month report](http://seattle.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=6967513&amp;GUID=BC05F387-BBAC-4BA3-AC78-8F378FB800D3) on store audits was presented to the City Council Finance and Neighborhoods Committee on Jan. 9.

Researchers are also studying changes in behavior due to the tax, but those findings won’t be available until later this year.

For the six-month store findings, the research team compared prices before and after the tax took effect at more than 400 stores in Seattle and three cities in south King County: Kent, Federal Way and Auburn. A comparison area was needed to account for any other factors that might have affected drink prices.

The researchers looked at soda, sports and energy drinks, teas and coffees, juices, powdered drink mixes, water, milk drinks, fountain drinks and other snack items. They surveyed stores from supermarkets to coffee shops. “This is one of the most comprehensive looks at beverages by a number of different store types,” said Jones-Smith.

Among the key findings:

* Supermarkets and superstores only passed through 86 percent of the increased costs, while smaller grocery stores, drug stores and shops passed on more than 100 percent of costs.
* The average pass-through rate varied, from 62 percent for bottled sugary beverages such as fruit juice to 111 percent for energy drinks. The average pass-through rate for soda was 102 percent.
* Diet and other drinks that were not subject to the soda tax increased significantly (up to 44 percent of the price of the tax in some stores).

Researchers were surprised by the latter finding. “It could be that smaller storeowners increased the price of non-sugary beverages that weren’t subject to the tax because they simply did not know better, or because it was an opportunity to boost profits,” Jones-Smith said. Or, it could be that distributors to these stores increased the price of these beverages as well, according to Jones-Smith. Supermarkets and superstores did not raise the price of these non-taxed beverages.

Stores chose different ways to inform consumers of the tax. Some posted signs and included the tax in the shelf price. Others made no mention of the tax on the price tag, and some assessed the tax at checkout.

Jones-Smith said researchers collected prices again in October and November of 2018, though that data has not yet been analyzed. They plan to survey stores again in fall 2019.

The tax raised nearly $17 million in revenue over the first three quarters of 2018. Jones-Smith said that was much higher than projected because the city conservatively estimated revenues. “The higher projections say nothing about actual consumption patterns,” she added.

Other partners in the soda tax research are Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the UW Center for Public Health Nutrition, the UW School of Social Work and the UW Evans School of Public Policy. Researchers are looking at consumption among low-income children, health outcomes and the impact on small-business revenue.

Welcome back to our weekly meetup, 7:30 PM at Optimism Brewing, 1158 Broadway. I'll set out board games on one of the tables so you can find us.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

Many different sorts of people show up, though male programmers in their mid-20s are common. Women and non-nerds are welcome too! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ

Q: *Does this happen every week?*  

A: Yes, except for some major holidays, or when Optimism is closed. I will make a cancellation post in either of those cases.

Q: *Do I have to bring games?*  

A: Nope! You're welcome to, but feel free to play the games that others and I have brought.

Q: *Will I be welcome there?*  

A: Yes, in all likelihood. We take weirdos, normals, all kinds. Just don't be an asshole.

Currently i work at IBM Egypt and i got the opportunity to move to the US permanently (green card) and i need some info on living costs, lifestyle etc etc.

Housing: It seems the US heavily relies on credit scores, can i move in to an apartment with no credit history?  background checks?

Jobs: will i face a hard time finding a job? average waiting periods? 

Living expenses: im leaving a high paying job and will start from scratch, so budgeting is my main stress right now. how much $$ do i need monthly to live comfortably? 

I'm quiet the outgoing person and not really touchy on the religious/politics topics. I will appreciate any piece of information that will make this transition easier in anyway.

I've borrowed a dehumidifier to see how low I can get it, it is now down to 47% after running for about 24 hours, though it hasn't gone lower. 

House is older, and pretty small (800 sq ft), so I think it is higher than ideal just because I cook, shower, and exhale indoors.

I'm considering taking an offer with a large software company in Redmond (ahem) and the commute is the only part I hear mixed opinions on. I live in Belltown pretty close to the Needle and don't have a car so I'd be on public transport for some time.   


The thing is, the morning route doesn't seem *that* bad at 40-45 min total but I am really not sure about the return trip. I'd work standard hours and be taking the 545 or 542 home. Google Maps makes it look like the trip is only 10-15 min longer but I've heard horror stories of regularly taking 520 westbound. I'd be hoping to make it home somewhat regularly by 5:30-6. I'm not against eventually getting a motorcycle for commuting so I could take the HOV but I don't know how bad it really is during rush hour nowadays and won't be able to really ""trial run"" that before accepting or declining the job offer.  


Any 2019 thoughts/experiences on this particular commute? I am sorry as I know it's been asked plenty of times in the past but it's hard to get an updated pulse on this from previous posts since I hear a lot has changed on bus routes and traffic over the past few years. Thanks!

&amp;nbsp;
We are in the middle of the winter and Seasonal Affective Disorder (Or SAD which is basically depressive symptoms due to weather patterns and the ‘gloominess’) could be affecting many of us. So here are a couple of tips on how to improve our mood during the darker months:   
&amp;nbsp;
**Vitamin D** - People with low vitamin D are at a much greater risk of depression and since our bodies absorb vitamin D primarily through sun exposure – from 15 to 2h of direct sun exposure a day— we might need to either get vitamin D via our diets (fish like salmon, some animal fats) or fortified food products, like orange juice and cereal and even take vitamin D supplements. 
&amp;nbsp;
**Social Life** - The #1 indicator to happiness among any gauge studied so far is Social Life. The more social life we have, the happier we feel so let’s get together with family and friends and enjoy a couple of coffees or beers together. If anyone needs a friend, send me a DM and we can get together so time.
&amp;nbsp; 
**Positive Worldview** - Remember, perception is reality and It’s the lens through which your brain views the world what matters since it SHAPES your reality. So, if there is a rainy day or a particularly gloomy environment over the city, let's embrace the grim and see the beauty in it. Seattle is a spectacular city also during the winter, we just need to change our perception. I particularly like the view from Gas Works Park while it rains.
&amp;nbsp; 
**Gratitude** - Studies have shown that consistently grateful people are more energetic, emotionally intelligent, forgiving and less likely to be depressed, anxious or lonely. So every day let’s give thanks for the good things we have and let’s celebrate life. Right now, think of 3 things that make you happy and smile over it.
&amp;nbsp; 
**Exercise** - This is the easiest and most powerful way to induce a positive mood in a short period of time. The effect is so clear that exercise is sometimes described as an anti-depressant. Let’s put our bodies in motion even if that means doing indoor action. Brownie points if the exercise means social activity as well.
&amp;nbsp; 
**Meditation and Flow** - I left this one for last since for the longest time I was skeptical and looked at meditation as ‘hippie’ stuff. However, meditation (at least 5 minutes a day of clearing the mind) create a utopian chemical environment to produce Serotonin and reduce Cortisol, making you a happier and healthier person. If meditation is not what you do or feels uncomfortable, look for activities that get you into FLOW or fully immersed and required your full involvement and enjoyment in the process of the activity.
&amp;nbsp;
**Therapist** - You are not crazy if you go to a therapist, sometimes 1h a week to talk to someone that will support you and commit to helping you might be a life changer. Most company Health Plans include mental health as part of the benefits or for a reduced co-pay. You do not have to tell anyone, and it is glorious how at easy you fell after some sessions. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not a therapist but a professor that have a course on happiness and live in Seattle – so feel free to ask if you guys are interested in more. 
&amp;nbsp; 
TLDR: To avoid being SAD during the winter -&gt; Take Vitamin D, go out with friends, have a positive attitude and give thanks, exercise, meditate and if necessary, look for a therapist. Seattle is a great city, but it takes some time to fully appreciate it during winter.

Just got a job offer in Tacoma and now planning my move, several questions

1) Should I consider living in downtown Tacoma or halfway between Tacoma and Seattle (right around SeaTac airport) to have both cities be more easily accessible?

2) I'm pretty big into nightlife and other social events, does Tacoma have a lot of that or is that mainly concentrated just in Seattle?

You may regrettably remember me as the person who posted a couple weeks ago about what the best high rises are in SLU. Hopefully we can all move past that unfortunate incident because I'm excited to share I'm officially moving to Seattle. Accepted a job today and will likely be there by the beginning of February!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm looking forward to joining this Reddit community (and hopefully the FB Group too.) Wanted to introduce myself and say hello. I'll be moving solo as a 32/F, working in Bellevue but hopefully living in Capitol Hill or SLU (somewhere that makes the transition from living in NYC for 15 years a bit easier!)

Also, thanks to everyone for contributing to the Best of Seattle thread - it's going to be a huge resource as a newbie. :)
