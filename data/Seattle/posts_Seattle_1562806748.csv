Hi, I'm Josh Ruiz, a Seattle **Uber driver** with over 4,100 trips, high ratings, and great reviews.  I was **shot by a passenger** with a 9mm handgun, was on life support, barely survived, and **now paralyzed.**

**\*\*WARNING GRAPHIC\*\***

**NEWS STORY:** [**VIDEO**](https://katu.com/news/local/uber-driver-shot-in-queen-anne)

**RECOVERY:** [**PICTURES**](https://ibb.co/album/fj5Qka)

**MY STORY**

On May 14th at 3:03 am 2019, I was given a passenger to pick up at a park off 10th ave in north Seattle. I quickly arrived and picked up my passenger. He sat behind me, we exchanged greetings, everything seemed to be normal (**He didn't seem intoxicated**). We had no further conversations or verbal exchanges for the remainder of the ride, until the accident. 

At Mercer and 5th ave **while driving** at a speed of 35mph - 40mph, a loud **explosion erupted from behind me** (or I so believed to be under me) I could **no longer move my left leg or foo**t. A feeling of numbness and what could be best described as **buzzing ran down my left side.** I pulled over as soon as I could find a safe place. My passenger started screaming ""Oh f\*\*k!"" repeatedly and quickly proceeded to exit my vehicle. My passenger was pacing back and forth outside repeatedly saying  ""Oh f\*\*k."". My passenger then began to walk off in what I assume was shock and fear. I called to him and exclaimed **""Dude, don't leave me like this""** as I begged him to call 911. (I still didn't know I had been shot at this time) I then lost consciousness.

I awoke to police yelling at me  ""Get out of the vehicle!"" while being yanked out my car and thrown face down to the ground. I yelled to them ""I'm an Uber driver! Grab my phone off of the dashboard!"" I passed out again. Allegedly, a police officer **stuck his finger in my entrance wound** until EMTs could arrive for proper medical attention. I shortly woke to **EMTs looking for ""the exit wound"".**  At that point, I realized **I had been shot**. They strapped me to a medical gurney and loaded me into the back of an ambulance. The EMTs then **instructed me to call my loved ones** and let them know what had happened, as **I was losing a lot of blood.** 

I woke up three days later in **ICU with over 130 staples**, a tube sticking out of my neck, an artery reconstruction, my kidneys shut down, needing dialysis, and **paralyzed** in my left leg. **Uber and insurance companies have failed to offer any financial help.** Since I was technically a contractor for Uber and I was hurt by an event ""within the car not by the car"" I have no health or personal injury coverage. I am in constant pain from the nerve damage in my leg and foot. I just hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. If you drive for a rideshare company please be safe, get a vest. **This was a senseless act of violence and negligence of an individual that should not have owned a firearm.** Thank you for listening, please show your support. I could really use a little financial help with this catastrophic and disruptive event in my life. The funds would go to help with living and medical expenses, as **I cannot work and** **Uber nor insurance companies have helped. AMA.** If you would like to show your support google ""ShotUberDriver"" and find the gofundme.

* Rented a kayak on lake Union and paddled around, that was super neat!

* I love the constant light drizzle, it feels great to walk around in

* your city is actually walkable. Random construction closed off some sidewalks kind of unexpectedly, but I didn’t need to use a car while I was here. I did take the monorail though because why not, we live in the future.

* ate at a restaurant called Fogon, place was pretty solid, great house margarita

* breakfast at a place called Barjot, solid vibe and fun music

* the water tower in Volunteer Park was a cool thing to stumble across, had some really great views from the top.

* the plant life here is quite beautiful. Lots of cool trees everywhere, nice to get a different feel than what’s on the east coast

Prior to working there, all I wanted to do was to sincerely inspire change in Seattle; my home.  I figured one of the ways to do so, was to work with those in need, maybe with all my years of living in seattle and this earth, maybe I could somehow pass on that information and learned lessons onto others I was an orphan and was fortunate enough to have been adopted.   My family gave me everything, a home, love, affection, an education, and so on.    So I figured that since I was retired, maybe I could work a few hours a week and do my part instead of complain 


Boy.... was I wrong.  


The idea of Mary’s Place is great, but with many great ideas, the execution was incredibly lacking.  Furthermore employees are overworked, INCREDIBLY UNDERPAID (Managers make $17 an hour and have only 1 support staff per floor.   That’s roughly 20+ guests per floor; and lest we not forget that each guest or couple have anywhere from 1 to 6 kids.  So each floor houses roughly 45+ people).   There’s only 1 Manager per shift and 1 Support staff per floor.   

Now in the beginning I assumed that “Hey, maybe they just don’t have enough interest, maybe they need to get the ball rolling on their web based applications &amp; general vision.”   Again, I was wrong.  Mary’s Place has an incredible amount of negative reviews left by former employees, many of which whom also wanted to simply help those in the community.  

Now, I would say it doesn’t get worse, but it does. 
How?  Say no more!!! 


You know those gently used items we all donate to Marys Place?   Only 10-30% gets used.  The other 70-90% is SOLD!!!!  Now, you may be thinking, well, they must use the proceeds for their homeless guests and families? Maybe even staff?    Well, you’re wrong again friend.    The truth of the fact is.... NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE MONEY GOES.   A lot of staff in the downtown EFS center tells me that the gift cards (whether it be Starbucks, Goodwill, Target, Amazon, etc....) is held by Marty (the current C.E.O).       Staff are tossed a bone, roughly $5-$10 Starbucks gift cards on the holidays (yup, Christmas too!  No cash bonuses for staff)
Furthermore Staff are INCREDIBLY OVERWORKED!   Many on-site directors are INCOMPETENT, and ALLOW DRUG USING GUESTS AND HABITUAL RULLE BREAKERS TO STAY... SIMPLY TO ENSURE CENSUS IS KEPT UP! 
But, you must ask yourself, why is there a census if Mary’s Place is a Non-For-Profit?   Oh, I’ll tell you why.

BECAUSE AS OF MAY 17th THE CITY OF SEATTLE PAYS MARYS PLACE TO HOUSE ANY AND ALL HOMELESS FAMILIES!  NO MATTER THEIR DRUG OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE BACKGROUND!   IN FACT, MARYS PLACE DOESN’T PARTAKE IN BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR ANY OF THEIR OUT OF STATE GUESTS!!!  THATS ROUGHLY 60% of their guests!! (Out Of state homeless families that admit into Mary’s Place). 


I’m tired and absolutely enraged!   I’ll post again tomorrow.  But tomorrow I’ll tell you if the sexual abuse scandals that have gone un-reported to police and the myriad of abuses the head office have partaken in (using expensive Seahawks &amp; Mariners Suites intended for guests and children for their own admonishments and parties.)    I’ll see you all tomorrow.    However I’ll ensure that I producer to you all the myriad emails I’ve kept over the last 5 years I was there.   


Thank you!

I've got a couple of great workshops that I am sponsoring this weekend on campus! Patty Suau is an artist and empowering speaker from Miami, FL. She is coming to Bastyr to help share her passion for creativity and sensuality. Both of these classes are open to the local community, students, partners, and friends. 

Her creative expression workshop is designed to help with communication when you need more than words. The flyer states that it is tailored towards using creative expression with clients, but this class is open to anyone who is looking for new and effective methods of communication. 

Her second workshop is more of an open discussion on sensuality. She will be leading a talk on emotional intelligence, pleasure requests, and the importance of slowing down in intimacy. She will also be incorporating some exercises to help individuals gain confidence in these practices. 

I’ve linked the flyers for more information on signing up for these classes. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!

Moved in on July 4th,  and found out the supposed owner lied and was in fact the renter.  

We were thrown out of there by cops and real owner within 36 hours of moving in. with no refund of any of the money we paid 2 days earlier.  We were told take us to small claims if we want the money back. To top it off, we were forced by police to abandon our outdoor cats as they ran us out of there.

This has left us homeless, I do have a 30 foot travel trailer which I'm hoping to park somewhere and live until we get paid in a few weeks.

 Currently my GF, my newborn premature kittens and myself are parked in Walmarts parking lot, scrambling to find a place to park before they ask us to leave.  

41 year old male. 35 year old female. No drugs, no drama, no bullshit at all. Just 2 hard working people that got scammed at a bad time.

We are willing to make just about any arrangements.  I have some cash, lots to barter with and a lifetime of construction trades I'm happy to employ in trade. My GF has multiple year experience running motels, and is a solid reliable person who knows just about every hospitality trade inside and out.

We would prefer to be near Tacoma but at this point it doesn't matter.  We just need to get this trailer off the streets and somewhere safe until we are able to rent somewhere

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be moving to Renton (or near Renton) next month. I've accepted an offer at REI Headquarters in Kent. I had some questions regarding the area and would appreciate any info I can get.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context:

* I will be moving (in the first year) by myself, but my girlfriend will be following within a year.
* My max monthly rent budget would be $1,800 for a 1bd/1ba.
* My goal is to bike to work in Kent (which is why I'm considering Renton)
* I enjoy the outdoors, specifically hiking, trail running and rock climbing / bouldering.
* I like beer
* I have a Tesla EV (mentioning this now to provide context for some questions later)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some questions off the bat:

1. Are there any neighborhoods that I should steer clear from? I've heard some areas are a bit sketchy.
2. What areas are the ""nice"" areas or the areas with more stuff to do?
3. Will auto theft / vandalism be a concern?
4. Are there any apartment complexes that people recommend and/or warn against?
5. Do apartment complexes typically have EV charging stations? None of the ones I've searched for on Trulia or Zillow have that listed as an amenity.
6. Are there any climbing / bouldering gyms nearby? The closest one I saw was near Bellevue.
7. Should I be concerned about my vehicle for the weather and/or road conditions? Especially considering if I'm driving up to the trailhead in some areas.  (I have a Model S 75D).

I’m hoping someone has had success somewhere in town and could point me in the right direction.
