I'm looking at some apartments off of Linden Ave between 130th and 145th, and Aurora Ave is the next street over. I've read that the neighborhood isn't great, and specifically that there are some issues with property crime and prostitution in this area. 

Is there any truth to this, or is it a reasonable area to live in if you were to take reasonable precautions like living in any other major city?

If you live or have lived in this area, I value your input as far as the feel of this neighborhood. When I was single many years ago, I lived in a rough neighborhood near DC, shootings, sex trafficking, armed robberies, the like, so that's my frame of reference. I'd like some perspective because I'd rather not move my wife and I into a similar situation.

Good morning! This Sunday, July 28th, several new laws in Seattle and King County will be going into effect. As someone who leans very far left politically, while also a member of the property management industry, I think it’s important for the average citizen to understand some of the power and tools that he or she has available when dealing with property rental, which can feel like an industry where the landlords/property owners have the majority of the power (because they do). Some of these law changes are pretty big, such as the recent changes to the eviction process, which greatly favor the tenant. I’ve compiled a small list of some of the changes, with the necessary reference numbers. 



**Animals (HB1026):**
-No city/county breed restrictions against specific breeds.


**Military (HB1138):**
-Service members may terminate a lease based on Change of Situation.


**Demolition, Removal, Change to Property (HB1462):**
-120 day notice minimum to tenants (20 day notice may still be required). 


**Rent Increases (HB1440):**
-Minimum 60 days of prior written notice of a rental increase. No rent increase priors to completion of initial lease terms (income based rent only require 30 days).


**Eviction Reform (HB5600):**
-Expands time to pay or vacate to 14 days. Requires “pay or vacate” notice. Requires Attorney General to post and translate notice. Defines “rent” as reoccurring and periodic charges identified within rental agreement as for use of premises. Changes application of payments. Amends language of summons. Defines when attorney fees can be awarded. Changes requirements for “alternative service.” Adds reimbursement from Landlord Mitigation fund.


**14 Day Process (HB5600):**
1st- Rent due
2nd- Service of 14 day
5th- Late fees begin
16th- Notice to Pay or Vacate Expires
18th-19th- Summons &amp; Complaint prepared and served
28th- Tenants response due
29th- Obtain Order to Show Cause
13th- Show Cause Hearing/ Order for Writ of Restitution 




**Rent Definition:**
-Recurring and periodic charges identified in the rental agreement for use and occupancy of the premises (may include utilities). 
-Rent is NOT nonrecurring charges such as late payments, damages, deposits, legal costs, and other fees (including attorney fees).


**Judicial Discretion** (areas where the property manager to has leeway to make judgment calls):
-Tenant’s willful or intentional default or intentional failure to pay rent.
-Whether nonpayment of rent was caused by exigent circumstances beyond their control that are not likely to occur again. 
-Tenant’s ability to pay judgment in a timely manner.
-Tenant’s payment history.
-Whether the tenant is otherwise in substantial compliance with rental agreement.
-Hardship on the tenant if evicted.
-Conduct related to other notices served in the last 6 months.



**Payment Plans:**
-Court can reinstate the tenancy and order a payment plan between landlord and tenant.
-Payment plan must be less than 90 days, and allow for at least one month’s rent every 30 days.
-If court hearing is after the 15th of the month, the tenant may elect to include the next month’s rent in the payment plan.


**Additional Eviction changes:**
-Attorney fees cannot be awarded in any default judgment.
-Attorney fees can be awarded if the judgment for rent is greater than two months rent or $1,200 in attorney fees, or if the tenant requests a stay and their tenancy is reinstated. 


**Landlord Mitigation Fund (what is needed):**
-Obtain a statewide Vendor ID Number.
-Compile the necessary documents.
-Complete the Landlord Mitigation Fund Application.


**Documents needed:**
-Obtain Washington Statewide Vendor ID Number.
-An executed and written rental agreement.
-Adequate proof of housing assistance.
-Rental Assistance Inspection Report.
-A completed move-in condition report, signed and dated by landlords.
-A tenant ledger showing any unpaid portion of rent and other charges.
-Notices related to unpaid charges.
-Photos of damage and photos of affected areas after repairs.
-Copies of repair invoices.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,165877,public,self,2019 Housing Law Changes,0,1564330986,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/cijhat/2019_housing_law_changes/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm in the late stages of interviewing for a dream job in Bellevue!

My wife is game to relocate (she is self-employed via the internet and can live anywhere) but she's very much an urban life sort of person (walkability, public transit, food delivery, bars, all that stuff) and I get the sense from my brief time in Bellevue that it would not be her vibe. But she has visited Seattle before and liked it quite a bit, despite saying it seemed small (we currently live in LA, and lived in NYC and Chicago before that).

On the other hand, I'm not that fussy about where I live as long as the rent for a large 2BR or small 3 BR is not more than $3000/month, my commute is usually under 40 minutes or so, and there are good bars and restaurants within 30 minutes by any method of transit.

I'd love to take the job but I think she would be much, much happier in Seattle. The problem is, every time I've Googled for personal stories about commuting to jobs in Bellevue from Seattle, I see people say it's horrible, that it's an hour and 15 minutes of torture on the bridge each way while paying a toll for the pain. That it's unbearable and no one should ever do it.

But my source of confusion is that I've been checking Google Maps directions from my prospective workplace in downtown Bellevue at 8:30 AM and 5:30 PM to and from various neighborhoods like Wallingford or Montlake or Capitol Hill, and it has consistently said 35-40 minutes every day this week.

To me, coming from LA, that's tolerable (I'd obviously prefer 35), but a 50 or 60 minute one is not. 50 minutes every couple weeks or so if there's an accident is one thing, I'm used to that, but if it's an hour both ways every day, that's a no-go.

I'm not sure what to think; which is right, Google Maps, or the Quora posts, etc. that I've seen on the subject? Because they tell two very different stories! Any natives who make the commute willing to clarify?
