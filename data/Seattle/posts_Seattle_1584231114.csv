Nothing to do with the Coronavirus.  I live in North Seattle where there are at least 8  walk in clinics and 6 hospitals most 9 to 5 but 2 the regular kind open 24/7 within 1.5 miles.  

I had a hard time finding a place where a doctor could see me.  I first went to the polyclinic by Seattle Athletic Club.  It is now a triage for upper respiratory treatment.  There are 2 people that screen you for the COVID-19 in the lobby.  I got a piece of paper that said... has been screened for the COVID-19.  Meaning i was fine to talk to a screening nurse for seeing a doctor.   Many people in line had masks.  I was given a mass amount of hand sanitizer the kind you find only in hospitals before i left the lobby.  I took the elevator up.  The 2nd floor was a check in with about 4 counters of practitioners.  Once i got through the line to see a nurse,  i was told i would only be seen if i had upper respiratory problems.  They told me to leave and printed a paper for me with clinics in the area and told me to go there.  The closest was lake city's urgent care next to O'Reilly but i understand that closed down for good so we didn't head there.  We passed pac med and i remembered they have a walk in so we went in.  This was 6 pm and they closed at 7. There were big signs to screen for COVID-19 that asked if you had been to iran Italy or china in the last 14 days to not go in. We went in and the admitting nurse told us the doctors went home exhausted so they were closing the clinic for the day.   They asked me a few questions, insurance,  last time i was there then said Good luck If i were you I'd go to the emergency room of northwest hospital.  Ok that's where we headed.  The emergency room was packed. I was told to wait.  The room was spinning. 
I was sitting in a chair curled up in a ball trying to not move,  with my eyes closed trying not to vomit.  My chair was next to the hand sanitizer.  They called my name, 
I followed the nurse,  she took my vitals.  No fever.  The nurses were ecstatic.  Told me i could wait in the locked waiting room. There was an empty area,  locked apart from the main waiting area.  There were couches.  I laid down and waited in there until they called me back to do an ekg and screen for heart and stroke. I was told to wait in the waiting room.  I asked if i could wait in the locked waiting room and the nurse said yes and unlocked it for me. There was now another couple that was also allowed in that were also waiting.  Now we were 4 in that special waiting room. I threw up 6 times. I hadn't eaten for 36 hours because i didn't want to vomit. 
I vomited bile.  The nurse came and said they could take me back. They did an MRI, took my blood for labs,  gave me suero.  I don't know the word in English.  Nutrients in liquid form through an IV. They also have me valium and anti- nausea medicine.  I do have a history of vertigo but it has been a long time since I'd had it this long
 I was going on 4 days.  Everything was normal.   i didn't have COVID-19 based on screening.  
  I wasn't tested but i didn't have a cough,  fever,  chills,  sore throat,  body aches,  becom in china, iran or Italy in the last 14 days or been in close contact with someone that tested positive. 
 I talked to nurses,  doctors,  phlebotomist, anyone that was treating me about what their life was like.  The nurses said they were overwhelmed by the people that thought they had COVID-19 but not the ones that actually had it.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,192750,public,self,,,Overloaded medical facilities,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/fiqwcu/overloaded_medical_facilities/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I doubt the money helps the state because casinos cause more problems in its vicinity via increased social and law enforcement needs. It’s only feeding the greed of the tribes and government. I was in them a couple, ten times these past weeks and there is way more than 250 people in that unnecessary enclosed space. I want to see the casino closed for sweet relief of getting my crack taken away but also because vulnerable elderly addicts and others are there for all bad reasons. The employees are forced to work instead of getting the two weeks paid leave. The compulsive gamblers are simply compelled to go. Black card/gold card members get hundreds in cash or free play multiple times a week to draw them in, all this adding more fuel to our virus problem. Than they all come out of the casino, and back to the community to possibly spread the virus. What other mass congregation of thousands has remained open that wasn’t necessary? What about four or five casinos worth of smoking or second hand smoke elderly all going to the hospitals near the same time?

I’m an hourly employ at a local school district. Then found out it’s be 6 weeks. 

I investigated the unemployment benefits available for those 2 weeks. I do not qualify bc I didn’t work 680 hours or more in 2019. However, I’ve worked more than 680 hours beginning September 2019 to present date. I’m eligible for unemployment benefits beginning April 12 as that’s the start of new fiscal quarter and the hourly amount calculation is updated to include Q1 2020. That is decent.

I’ve been hustling to get insurance benefits from my employer as 630 hours are needed. I met that on March 4. A memo from Governor’s office states benefits eligibility apply only to hours worked up to the declaration of emergency on Feb. 29. I had 626.5 of 630 needed hours accumulated on that day. 

I’m ineligible until school resumes. We pay out of pocket for high cost and deductible plan, and wanted to drop it so fast. Looks like it will be delayed until May. 

I’m mad about what seems an arbitrary Feb 29 cut off date for benefits eligibility. I worked and schools were open until this week. That time not being counted towards benefits eligibility is maddening and seems wildly misguided. I hope it works out. 

These 2 short comings related to health care and supplemental income during unforeseen circumstances really makes me question my employment choices and concerned about the support government provides to low to middle income earners during unusual circumstances. 

I’ll find additional income. I believe. However, $700 per month for insurance is not helping us at all during this time. Maybe it’ll help if we’re injured or ill. 

The unemployment benefits current exclusion, and health insurance exclusion are the primary annoyances I’ve experienced among a plethora of lessor BS.

Ive learned a good bit about unemployment benefits if anyone has simple questions. 

I’m living in an apartment, I’m not sick, I can support myself during this time, and other people need assistance Much more than I do.
