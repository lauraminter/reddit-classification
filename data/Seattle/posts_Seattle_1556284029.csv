I need to find a woman thats about my same age or within a handful of years (I’m 32) that’s willing to have a chat in front of an audience (viewing via live stream).  All expenses paid, and you might make some money too.  Vague enough, right?

Here’s the more detailed version. I’m an aspiring streamer and I’d like to film a “blind date.”  Will be about 100-200 (hopefully more) viewers based on prior history.  Looking for someone that can engage in a conversation and won’t rely on one person carrying the conversation, and won’t get camera shy all of a sudden. There is a small chance this will be a group date.

You (or whoever you think would fit) would need to have thick skin and aren’t easily offended. Not because of what I say, but there will be a Bluetooth speaker that will say things outloud.  Some of the things might be crass or just insulting.  If someone donates money that they want to give directly to you, I will Venmo it to you after the funds clear. 

I would need someone that can recommend places for ya to go or activities for us to do, since I’m totally new to the city.

And, saving the most shallow bit for last - I’m looking for someone that’s healthy and attractive, which is obviously subjective, but for that reason, I’d like to at least know what you look like before hand.  Not going to lie, some of it is just because it’d be nice, but a large part of this is because of viewer attraction and retention.  I’m sure you don’t want to hang out with a wildebeest on camera for hours on end so I’m happy to share my pictures as well with anyone that may have the faintest interest.

You’re free to plug your socials or your own channels or whatever else you want on top of the expenses being paid and whatever viewers want to give you. Depending on how well the channel grows during the stream, i may compensate you directly too.

I know this is a long shot, and this will probably be removed, but I’m hoping maybe someone is interested or knows someone that may be interested. It will be at minimum fun and something new to do, and at best, a new friend and you make some money.

Feel free to drop questions etc in the comments or dm me if interested.  I don’t want to self promote so I won’t link the channel here but if I find a partner from this thread I will definitely update with it!

The hitch? I live in Mexico. We could not find a flight from Portland that did not change planes in a city at a time the temps would 100% be below the required 85 degrees and land in Guadalajara in the morning or evening when it would be cool enough here (May is the hottest month here.) So someone from the rescue is driving Sheldon to Sea-tac so I can get a direct flight leaving at night and arriving in the morning

I arrive at 8:30 in the morning and do not fly out till 10:30 at night. I would like - of all things - to go to Target and also eat Taco Bell. I know a Taco Bell will close enough to Uber to, but that Target might be too much of a haul. Google map tells me that there is one 25 minutes away on 2nd street but then it gives me almost the same route to one on Northgate. And then for grins Google decided to put “Seattle airport” in Jocotepec which I know has busses and horses but zero airports. 

Could someone give me the street that the closest Target is to the airport? And does Google’s time of under a half hour translate to true traffic time? Am I asking for trouble to leave the airport?

Gracias.

I’m looking to visit Seattle for a weekend sometime in July.

• Could I rely on getting around via public transit as my pup will be with me? He’s my ESA and he’s well behaved, but not formally trained.

• What areas of the city should I look for my Airbnb that’s close enough to the main hustle and bustle so I could walk with my dog, drop him off quickly if necessary or take the metro? 

• Otherwise if my dog will not be accommodated on the rail should I look into renting a car through Turbo? Does anyone have past experience with this service they could share? I have never heard of this until last night when I was beginning my research. (In general, is it more comfortable to have a car in this city? Is parking reasonable?)

Me and my fiance are thinking of moving to Washington here in a couple of years (yes I know a bit far away but I would still love to research early). We would like to know what are the ""good"" and ""bad"" areas of Washington to raise a family. We are moving from Phoenix (which yes I know it's cheaper to live down here, but we would like a change of scenery, Go Cards!). We make decent amount of money and will only go up hopefully by the time we move. I have stayed in Vancouver, WA before and I loved it but I loved all of Washington and Portland when I visited as well. We wouldn't really look into moving into the city since I know it can get pretty pricey, so what are the more suburban neighborhoods that aren't too far from the city because me and her both work downtown currently and would probably work in a downtown area again.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the hospitality last week. The weather was cooperative and beautiful, and the food delicious. I know I didn't experience more than a small portion of what the city has, but I definitely want to come back for more.

&amp;#x200B;

Husky Deli, Buddha Ruksa (the chef/owner? gave attentive and engaging table service to everyone), Bar Melusine, and Queen Khmer Deli were the (food) highlights of my visit. Skal Beer Hall was pretty neat--I had never tried mead before, and their spicy/sweet mustard dip was amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Southgate Roller Rink: worst idea ever. Seriously, who thought it'd be a good idea to combine rollerskating, beer, and a ramp? Probably the best time I had the whole week. I'd probably go several times a week if I lived near there.

&amp;#x200B;

Walking around Lincoln and Seahurst parks, the locks, and downtown was great. I loved when two guys were trying to find a bus station and found a large group of people (about 15-20?) standing around. ""Look, this must be the bus stop that they're all standing around for."" ""No, the bus stop is on the next block. We're here for the Pokemon raid.""

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you enjoy some of the shots I grabbed while walking around.

There is a woman who has been hitting up some beauty supply stores along the I-5 corridor but mostly downtown Seattle. She’s stolen hundreds to thousands worth of hair extensions and is possibly scouting stores to make sure someone is working alone so she can get away with it. She came into my store again today, taking out something she stole last time out of her purse to color match, she was closely watched, and got uncomfortable to the point of storming out after trying to make me uncomfortable about following her. I was not discreet about watching her and the second I recognized her I was already over it so I didn’t care if she knew. I know their patterns and I’ll make it obvious that I know. 

Luckily nothing was taken this time, but it was still very violating and infuriating that she came back. I can’t believe she had the audacity to come in not even a week after she stole from us. 

**Important stuff**
She’s a woman in her 30’s-40’s, fake tan, medium length overly processed platinum blonde hair that’s usually up and in a hat, blue eyes, 5’3”-5’5”, chunky eyelashes, carries a large tan tote, and usually wearing athleisure.
