I'm planning on finding a room in someone's house for a few months and getting whatever job I can. I've lived in Portland my whole life, but this city is a cultural, intellectual, social, and artistic shithole. All second rate shit and the people are asocial. The natural beauty has kept me here for a while but I can't stand it any longer, I want out. Seattle feels 50 years ahead of Portland, maybe more, and the nature is better except for the coast. I assume y'all have better people than Portland since Seattle is larger and more international. Looking forward to pissing away my weekends in the national forests and parks around the area. I have a BS in math and philosophy so I'm sure I can find some godforsaken job in the area that at least pays 20/hr, but if I can't, I'm used to being poor. Can't say I have much ambition to climb career ladders but it's nice to know you have an actual economy instead of Portland's healthcare+everything-else-lite. My main memory of Seattle is of taking the ferry in from Bainbridge after hitchhiking around the Olympic Peninsula and ending up at the library for several hours. A wonderful library, futuristic and architecturally invigorating. I spent some hours there and then sat outside on the steps where two random men struck up a conversation with me. We talked for two hours and it was wonderful. I ended up going home with one of them to sleep, and in a fascinating turn of events he ended up smoking meth and then sucking my cock for a while. A brief epiphany on human intimacy and love. A real surprise, and he had the same name as me. The next day I took the Bolt bus home. Look, I think if you guys increased your overall density in the downtown and the surrounding areas, you could be the next great American city, up there with SF, LA, NYC, Boston, and Chicago. I recently drove around the whole US and Seattle was one of the only cities where I laughed and smiled while driving though. An actually beautiful city. The most beautiful stand alone mountain in the lower 48.  The closest 48-competitor to California in terms of natural beauty. Lots of love from down south and hope to see y'all very soon. May God help me get through the next few weeks here in miserable Portland.

And to answer the obvious questions: a) I'll sleep in my car at rest stops near Seattle until I find a place to live, and b) I plan on being a productive member of society and not just some homeless junkie who freeloads off the taxpayer funded programs for the homeless.

These facts are even more true for King County residents.

So if you live in Seattle, not only are you subsiding republicans in your own state with the states sales tax, you are subsidizing republicans in the rest of the country with your federal income tax.

If you ever wonder why there is no money for transportation, but there is always money for perpetual wars and wall street and farmer bail outs, its because Washington state, and others, have an exploitative relationship with the federal government.

You would think the states funding the government would have the most say in how that money is spent. Except the opposite is true. 

Washington has some of the least say on how DC is ran.

Despite Washington being the 11th largest state, its the 8th highest state on the list of ""most exploited for republican gain"".

Is Washington also always taken for granted in national elections? 

You bet it is.

Of the top 10 donor states, 80% are blue states - and the two red states on the top 10 list have a combined population of less than half of Washington.

And then there is homelessness.

Because King County is so easily exploited for its money by poor republicans in Kentucky and around the country, and its progressive values, there is nothing stopping poor states from sending their problems here, because we can ""afford"" it and they often do. 

Its not like we need the money to take care of our own problems, forcing cities to fend for themselves with head taxes.

Well Oregon must be in the same situation right? Nope. Oregon gets back 31% more of their federal tax dollars than Washington, a whole $1.29 compared to our $0.98 cents.

Thats not a lot of money is it? 

If Washington got back from the federal government what it pays in at the same rate as Oregon, the state would be owed $24 Billion Dollars a year, or half of what is need to complete ST3.

Dont want to pay MVET? Sound Transit fully funded in 2 years and you can keep your $30 car tabs. 

Only if you get angry enough to stop DC from ripping us off.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/bobabucha-seattle-2?start=20

New place called Bobabucha in Capitol Hill. Absolutely amazing reviews. My girlfriend convinced me to go there based on that.

We get there, order some drinks. None of what we order looks anything like the pictures. But whatever, if it's good, who cares?

Kombucha was not carbonated, tasted bitter and tart, and had no distinct flavor. I don't believe there was ever any SCOBY because I'd recognize the taste. I gave up halfway through and threw it out.

She ordered the Queen Anne Rose, tasted nothing like what people described in reviews and was overly sweet, room temperature, and she had to force herself to finish it.

Try it out for yourself and report back, especially if you're a kombucha or boba tea fan. 

This review on the second page is spot on:

&gt; First off, I just want to say that most of the people giving reviews on this page own Instagram pages where they post about the food that they purchase, or more often, are sponsored for. I went to BobaBucha during their opening week, and I was hesitant to give this place a review bc the owners seem like genuinely nice people but they need to improve their bubble tea quality especially in a city like Seattle. I ordered the Thai Tea with some sort of dairy alternative and black ball tapioca. The tea itself tasted like water, while the tapioca balls were way to hard in texture to chew. My friend ordered some kind of Mt. Rainier tea with crystal boba. After he tasted it, the crystal boba had popped and blended with the taste of the tea. In short, my tea tasted like water with hard boba and my friend's tasted like a chemical mixture. I truly hope this place improves their quality of bubble tea bc the owners were super nice and it was in a great location.

This is a city filled with software developers, why isn't there a knockoff version of Yelp that avoids all their shady business practices and bans douchebag instagram influencers?

I want to buy a nice pair of slippers for my grandma for Christmas (technically my boyfriend's grandma). I've lived here for years now, and I have no idea where to go that's not either Target or Amazon or other cheap places. But I want something nicer!

I live in Capital Hill, and have access to a car, so anywhere is pretty much fine. In the past I'd go to the mall and wander, but I know that malls aren't doing so well anymore. At this point, I have no idea who'd sell that sorta thing anymore!

We are both 25, and don’t have many connections in the area. We won’t be able to afford living in the city and were thinking of living in either West Seattle, Kent, Federal Way, or Tacoma. I do not have a job lined up, but her office will be in Pacific, WA. We are hoping to get recommendations or experience in living in a few of those areas, what the commute time might look like to Pacific, and what areas might be best for a young outgoing couple looking to make friends.

Our budget will be $1400-1800/month and we are hoping for a 2 bedroom. We’ve heard West Seattle recommended as a younger, vibrant area but is on the more expensive side. Would she hate her life commuting to Pacific twice a day if we lived there? From 2 friends I know of who live in Tacoma, they say it’s usually a 45 minute drive WITHOUT rush hour traffic. But, someone she knows from work says that rush hour wouldn’t be bad since she’d be going the opposite way most people are driving at those times. We’ve also talked about it and she says she wouldn’t mind an hour commute each way, but would it be longer than that?

Our same friends told us that there is a lot to do in Federal Way, and it’s obviously much closer to her work. Is this an alright area to live in?
