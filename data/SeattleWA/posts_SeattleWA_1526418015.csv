I had a homeless man block my path and demand I give him $0.50. I don’t carry cash ever and definitely not when I’m out walking my dog. When I said no he went on a rant at me. I stood my ground while he yelled and eventually said very firmly “Are you going to continue blocking my path or do I need to get louder?”  He moved. My dog is a German Shepherd and it was pretty stupid of this guy to approach me and my dog. It was also on a very well lit street next to a gas station. 

There is a different homeless man who has chased me and my dog twice (both times in broad daylight) because he “doesn’t like the way the dog looked at him”.  I’m going to start carrying pepper spray with me now. 

This morning I took my dog on the same .2 mile loop of the neighborhood that I take every morning. There were 3 people sleeping on the sidewalk and one man sleeping in the bushes. That’s one person per .05 miles.  These were just the people that were blocking the sidewalk and not counting the others I know that sleep in alleys and nooks of the buildings nearby. 

I moved to Seattle 2.5 months ago from New York and am just so blown away by this. I have never seen anything like this in NY. People were just stepping over the people sleeping on the sidewalk.  For context, I live near the big 3 hospitals where police presence is bigger than normal for the rest of the city (Ive learned SPD is grossly understaffed). Is this normal practice for the police to do nothing when there is someone sleeping on the sidewalk? 

I called the non-emergency police line a couple weeks ago when there was a couple having sex in their car on that road between Frye and St James cathedral and the catholic school. Not discreet sex either, loud and obnoxious. The first thing dispatch asked me was “Does it look consensual?”  I said, “If I say no, will you send someone faster?” Dispatch laughed at me....

As someone who is really interested in social science, I do find it all oddly fascinating. As a human though, I think it’s tragic.  I lived in NY through Willam Bratton’s terms as police commissioner and, though it wasn’t an easy adjustment for a lot of people, I do wish someone or something like that would come to Seattle. This city has so much potential and it’s hard to watch it go to waste. 

I hope Seattle can get it together and learn from other cities mistakes and victories in order to come up with an effective and efficient plan to make this city the best it can be. Unfortunately, history seems to always repeat itself. Thanks for reading.

I figured I would do a post about why crows dive bomb, what to do to avoid getting swooped at, and what not to do.


First, for those who don't know, fledgling season is the time of year when baby crows start to leave the nest. Baby crows aren't particularly proficient at flying and hiding yet, so when you get too close mama and papa crow swoop at you to scare you off. Don't take it personally (yet) they just don't know if you are a predator or not so they err on the side of caution.


**So what can you do to avoid getting swooped? **


1. Pay attention. Crows very rarely swoop without warning. If you hear a crow's caw nearby during this time of year, it is possible that they are warning you to back off.


2. Maintain eye contact. Crows' mode of attack is to come from behind so if you face them as you move through the danger zone, you will be less likely to get hit.


3. If you don't fancy the idea of walking backwards to keep eye contact with a crow you can always do the next best thing, wear a mask with eyes on the back of your head (or use an umbrella). Seriously, crows are smart but they can't differentiate between a mask and a human face so if it thinks you are always watching, it won't make a move.


**Things you should not do**


1. Throw things, yell at, or otherwise try to intimidate the crows (at the very least not without a disguise on). Crows have very good memories and have been found to tell other crows about dangerous individuals. A UW study found that when a person in a mask intimidated a single crow alone and then reintroduced it to a group, not only did the group attack the masked person from then on, but generations of crows moving forward attacked them. Seriously, be nice to crows or it will become personal for a long time.


2. Pick up the crow babies. For the most part the fledglings will get along fine with mom and dad. The only exception is if they are in the road. If you find a baby crow in distress in the road, disguise yourself with a big hat or umbrella before you move it unless you want to branded as a threat by crowkind henceforth.


I hope that is a decent primer for folks looking to keep the crows out of their hair. I will mention that if you have a crow nest in your yard during fledgling season I have found the best way to mitigate swooping is to feed them occasionally (like once a week at most, you don't want them dependent on you). Toss a handful of sunflower sseeds on the ground and make sure they see your face, they will eventually mark you as not a threat and let you pass unharassed. If you don't want to do that, invest in a mask or umbrella.",False,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,56907,public,self,It's Fledgling Season!,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/8jmauw/its_fledgling_season/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I originally posted this as a reply to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/8jj6a7/enabling_addicts_is_not_compassionate_its_cruel/). 

I'm going to be celebrating 5 years clean this year and I just submitted to do a TEDx Seattle talk called **It’s time for “Safe Injection Sites”** in Seattle and Why We Should Stop Calling Them That. Omitting a lot of personal information (the entire first paragraph so it'll seem like an abrupt start), I'll copy and paste the entire thing. It's designed to be a 12 min. talk so keep that in mind:

*Every 12 hours, someone within the Greater Seattle Area overdoses.*

“Safe injection sites” are rooms in which an addict can use drugs under the supervision of medical professionals and be resuscitated by them in case they overdose. The idea is to keep an addict alive long enough to expose them to treatment. Because we know that threatening people with jail don’t work. We now that this is an illness that is treatable and harm reduction methods such as these are key.

The sites being proposed here in King County are called Community Health Engagement Locations or CHEL. I started this talk by calling them “Safe Injection Sites” because that’s what they are known to be called. But we should start using the correct term. Because in this case, the opponents are right – there is nothing safe about using drugs. In fact, even “injection” isn’t correct because not all addicts are IV users. Using the correct words are important.

Community Health Engagement Locations – key word: engagement. These sites will have medical professionals, social workers, therapists – you name it, we’ll have it. The people who argue against CHELs say that by allowing these sites we would be giving addicts permission to use. Well, I have news for you:

Addicts weren’t waiting for our permission.

Addicts are purposely using in public places just in case they overdose. This way someone might be able to save them if they do. They are already creating their own safe spaces.. Addicts don’t use in public places to be a nuisance, it’s because they want to live. We see needles everywhere not because addicts don’t care, it’s because when you’re high, sometimes you forget. And believe me, addicts want to keep their needles for future use. We see sharps containers in bathrooms in grocery markets across the state. These stores will say that these containers are for ‘diabetics’ – but we all know that these aren’t emptied every month because diabetics are shooting insulin inside their bathrooms every day…it’s for the users. One of those users was my friend, Audrey. She overdosed on a Safeway bathroom 3 days after I celebrated my first year clean. She was 26.

In fact, these are the exact same arguments that were used against the needle exchange programs in the 80s during the height of the AIDS epidemic. That we would be enabling addicts to use. These programs provide syringes, tourniquets, and HIV/Hepatitis education free of charge to encourage users to bring back their dirty needles in exchange for clean ones, that way they don’t share them with each other. And it worked. I credit the needle exchange as the sole reason that I don’t have any collapsed veins or other communicable diseases associated with IVs. Today, if you are accidentally exposed to a dirty needle, you only have a 0.03%-0.3% chance of getting HIV – and that’s according to the CDC. This is entirely due to the needle exchange.

Another added benefit to CHELs is that homeless women will have medical professionals be able to spot a pregnancy before they themselves can. Because when you are homeless, birth control is not exactly a high priority - and when you are high, it’s hard to tell pregnancy symptoms from withdrawal so if we can intervene early enough in the pregnancy…we just may be able to spare that baby from spending its’ first moments of life withdrawing from drugs.

Concerns over high crime rates near existing sites are majorly flawed because they lack context. These sites are determined by how crime-ridden the neighborhoods are. In other words, those neighborhoods were crime-ridden, to begin with. CHELs didn’t raise the level of crime…It was already there.

CHELs have had zero deaths from over 100 sites around the globe. Do you have any idea what that means to someone like me? In the 12-step fellowship community, there is a saying told to newcomers fresh into sobriety: “You should buy something nice to wear because you’re either going to go to a lot of funerals…or you’ll at least have something nice to be buried in.”

Opponents say that overdoses have risen near CHELs but that’s the equivalent of blaming the doctor treating cancer patients for the rise in cancer deaths. Cancer causes cancer deaths, not the doctors treating them. CHELs provide the ability to test drugs for harmful additives. Overdoses have skyrocketed worldwide but that’s because heroin isn’t heroin anymore, it’s carfentanyl. To give you an idea of how strong carfentanyl is - here is a basic breakdown of the potency of opioids:

Morphine is a prescription painkiller, it’s street equivalent is heroin. Dilaudid is 10x stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is 100x stronger than morphine. Carfentanil is 10,000x stronger than morphine. Let me break that down for you one more time.

Heroin = Morphine

Dilaudid = 10x stronger than Morphine

Fentanyl = 100x stronger than Morphine

Carfentanyl = 10,000x stronger than Morphine

A table salt grain worth of carfentanyl can kill a grown man. It was originally used to tranquilize elephants but was discontinued because it was too strong. I can’t make this stuff up. In fact, DEA agents are overdosing from it on drug raids from skin contact. It is taking an average of 4-5 doses of Narcan/Naloxone (an opioid overdose medication) to bring someone back from a carfentanyl overdose. That means that if you overdose and carry Narcan on you, you better hope that 4 or 5 of your friends do too. Drug dealers are cutting their drugs with this substance to cut costs. It is being manufactured in bulk in places like China and cut here in the U.S. being passed off as Heroin and other drugs. Here’s the problem: drug dealers are not chemists. They don’t even realize that they are killing off their own customers. And it is in their best interest to keep their customers alive for return business. This is why it is not called the heroin epidemic but the opioid epidemic – because heroin the way we knew it doesn’t exist anymore.

All of this information is originally cited from the Opioid Summit that I attended in May, 2017. It was put on by the Attorney General in response to Governor Inslee’s executive order to address the epidemic. A three-day summit full of speakers from different backgrounds - law enforcement, medical professionals, and other experts - it was basically the Ted Talk of opioids. Out of all of the speakers that spoke, however, not one was a person in long-term recovery. People with substance use disorders should be able to speak for themselves. With the rise of #BlackLivesMatter, Parkland student activists, and the #Metoo movement - we have illustrated the desperate need to stop “saviors”. The best thing to do is to step aside and create a space for them to speak. It’s time to stop trying to speak for them but to help elevate their voices.

We need to educate our lawmakers to use the correct terminology and advocate for proven results. While I was working as a photographer in Olympia for the Washington State Legislature, I saw everything. One moment that particularly shocked me was when I once witnessed during a House floor debate one of our elected officials say that “Marijuana kills 60% more people than Tobacco cigarettes.”

Lastly, the most important factor of all: opioid addicts are at the very bottom of the priority list – because you can’t die from an opioid withdrawal. You feel like you’re dying but you can’t actually die from an opioid withdrawal. In fact, you can only die from an alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.

There are only two not-for-profit detox centers in all of King County. A population greater than 12 states. And when you are a drug addict fighting for one of those spots, it gets even more difficult if you are solely an opioid addict because a withdrawal for them is considered non-life threatening. When I tried to get in, they told me to try again in 5 days. An employee unofficially told me to drink a six-pack to up my chances of getting into detox and I still didn’t get in. I’ve never seen the inside of a detox center in my entire life.

Opponents of CHELs will state that they support expanding treatment centers instead. Well, it doesn’t matter how many detoxes we open, because opioid addicts will still be at the bottom of the priority list. You’d have to open a detox the size of all of Swedish Hospital to even come close to addressing the need. And if we had the option of expanding treatment, wouldn’t we have done it already?

It takes an average of 7 times offering treatment for a user to finally go. If we could predict a place where we know addicts will be every single day and concentrate our limited resources in one place, we could expose users to treatment every single day. I’ve never known an addict that didn’t eventually want to get clean. That moment of clarity is brief and we must act upon it when it strikes. That means in addition to CHELs, we need to advocate for same-day treatment. No more waiting.

I’ve always thought that I was too inexperienced, too young, and not educated enough. People in recovery are the most capable people I know. We are people who woke up broke, rich by noon, every day. If you want to get anything done…ask a person in long-term recovery. Frankly, we are already cheating death every single day simply by breathing clean &amp; sober.

Despite the unanimous support for these sites from the King County Heroin Task Force – comprised of medical professionals, law enforcement officers, etc. - there is fierce opposition to CHELs. This is a disease that affects all within both parties. As a Democrat, I can honestly say that one of the most powerful and eloquent speeches I’ve ever seen on behalf of addicts came from a Republican. This is topic we must come together on because it’s not about you anymore…it’s about them, …we are your family, fellow human beings…and most of us are still trapped in there, that dark place that I never want to return to ever again, a place with no doors or light, no ability to move or breathe. It is hell. There are no mincing words about addiction. It is horrifying to lose the ability to control your actions. My body did not belong to me anymore. Heroin was my only friend, family, and higher power. My mind, body, and soul were utterly broken and any semblance of the kind, bright, energetic Sunday school-teacher with four godchildren was gone. No…I no longer existed.

My father told me…

My name means ""true self"":

""When you are reborn, you will realize the true image of yourself.""

I died within my addiction. In recovery I was reborn. But there are so many of my brothers and sisters are out there dying every single day. We cannot pull any of the options off of the table if we have even a glimmer of hope to slow this epidemic. Because what we have done isn’t working. Everything we have tried has failed. I beg of you to do the right thing. Fight for what is right and help save us all. I promise you, this will work.

My policies are very clear for anyone to understand.  I have a plan to end Seattle's growth and especially in the tech swctor.


Growth is a good thing but it needs to be controlled. 


First policy is I would work with the state government and the governor to get a statewide income tax.

2nd policy: Licensing fee would be lowered for WA residents who have been here over 3 years and it would be double dipped for new arrivals.


If you paid $54 for a license then you will pay $25 if you have been here longer than 3 years however if you have been here longer than a year and shooter than 3 then you will pay $54. The new arrivals will pay $83.

3rd: I would draft policies that expand to fees car tabs and other state taxes.

4th: I wouldn't let multi billion dollar corporations get away without paying their fair share.  It's better to have 10k small businesses replacing Amazon than having one thief destroying the entire city. Seattle must destroy the growth and we must end this crisis. Life is getting horrible for those born and those who were here for decades.


Income tax

55% percent for those who make over 250k
37% percent for those who make over 100k
25% percent for those who make over 65k
14% percent for those who make over 32k
5% percent for those who make above 12k

No tax foe those who make under 12k

I am involved in the recovery community in Seattle, and I see a lot of people who struggle with this disease. I talk to addicts who are homeless, and it is clear to me that the homelessness problem here is, at least in large part, an addiction problem. Therefore, in large part it can only be solved as an addiction problem. I believe that the city is falling into a classic trap in trying to help addicts, and in this approach it is destined to fail, and make the problem worse if it continues.

In Alanon, there's a concept called codependence. It's when a person, usually with good intentions, protects the addict from the consequences of their addiction. They tell lies for the addict, lend him money, give him a place to stay, etc. Often, the codependent feels like they are helping the addict, and that the addict would die without them. Deep down, they sometimes get a sense of self worth, or even self righteousness from being depended on.

Codependency can almost be seen as a form of addiction in and of itself. Like addiction to a substance, it is a pattern that is hard to break, and it can trick the codependent into thinking that he or she is doing the morally correct thing. 

If either the addict or the codependent is to be helped, this dynamic must be broken. The codependent must stop protecting the addict from the consequences of his or her addiction. Otherwise the addict **will continue to use until they die**. The codependent must be made to see their own role in the cycle, and must be taught that enabling is not an act of compassion.

Sadly, the city of Seattle seems to have fallen into the role of enabling codependents to the addicts that live on the streets. The city allows them to shoot up and sell in broad daylight, unmolested by the police. It allows them to set up camp in public spaces. It provides food and shelter without expecting them to seek treatment. It allows them to be protected from the consequences of their using, and in doing so it allows them to continue using. 

Now the city wants more money from Amazon and other companies to help fight homelessness. They propose to continue the same approach: more housing, more benefits, more money thrown at services. All carrot and no stick. This approach will fail, and it will make the problem worse. The only way to solve the addiction problem is stop protecting the addicts from the consequences of their using: Those who shoot up or sell in public should be arrested. Camping in public spaces should not be allowed. In summary, laws should simply be enforced, just as they are in most other cites around the world. 

Addiction is a tricky beast, only those who have been there can truly understand. I don't hate addicts, on the contrary I see them as brothers and sisters. I also know that the only way to help them is to not enable them. Doing so is not compassionate, it's cruel, and it will end up with more of them dead.

Amazon currently occupies or plans to occupy 45 different office buildings equalling 13.6 million square feet. Let that sink in for a moment. That is equivalent to 236 football fields of office space. In 2 years, Amazon has already doubled their office space with even more growth planned. Their growth has been quick and accelerant. 


Per a Times report in 2017, Amazon occupied 19% of all prime office space in Seattle -- unclear what 'prime' is defined as. But the more notable figure is Amazon's 19% is more than double that of any other company owning/leasing prime office space in any other city. 


There is no denying Amazon's likely record setting speed and size of growth in a major city.


In my observance, two sides exist in the debate over Amazon and Seattle. On one side, Amazon has brought Seattle expansive growth and an economic boom. On the other side, tech salaries are gentrifying neighborhoods and either driving low/lower-mid income families out of the city or burdening finances via billowing housing costs. I think both sides can agree that growth and economic opportunity are good, as well as affordable housing and manageable finances. So what gives? Why are people up in arms over this 'conflict?'


The *speed* of change.


Change is uncomfortable. Fast change that sweeps across you like a tidal wave, forcing you into decisions or to make a decision faster than you'd like is even more uncomfortable -- you don't have the power or control to make the decision that's most wanted, you end up making a decision that's available and needed. Change this fast can completely wash away the viability of your 1 year, 3 year, and/or 5 year plans. Some people that thought it was a given they would grow up/raise their kids in Seattle can no longer afford it. Other's are unwilling to let the dream die, and put financial handcuffs on their budget to make the mortgage work; putting themselves at risk in an economic downturn. The life many thought they could have in Seattle is no longer financially possible. 


The *speed* of change has never allowed a norm to settle, or allowed expectations to organically change as to how and where one can afford to live. The people of Seattle were caught off guard by the giant corporation and peripheral tech companies that have grown, and grown, and grown over the past decade. 


The point of all of this is to remind everyone to see through the angry, passive aggressive, and remorseful conversations and messages pointed at Amazon/tech/population boom, and to see those emotions as manifestations of the true meaning behind the cast veil. There is a human-side to every story, with real emotions and real impacts. Both sides must have compassion and understanding. Both sides must find solutions that equally benefit all.

“We are disappointed by today’s City Council decision to introduce a tax on jobs. While we have resumed construction planning for Block 18, we remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here. City of Seattle revenues have grown dramatically from $2.8 billion in 2010 to $4.2 billion in 2017, and they will be even higher in 2018. This revenue increase far outpaces the Seattle population increase over the same time period. The city does not have a revenue problem – it has a spending efficiency problem. We are highly uncertain whether the city council’s anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better.”

I have been using ethnographic techniques and semi-structured interviews with participants of the gay community to see how social factors play roles in the elevation and marginalization of certain groups within the community. Studying roles like perceived gender, race, sexuality, and class help to paint the larger picture of who the marginalized are in the gay community. Alongside this, I am also creating a film on LGBTQIA+ experiences to highlight the trials and success of the LGBTQIA+ community as a whole.

In 2014, there were seven Seattle neighborhoods where the median rent was affordable for a family making between $52,000 and $79,000 a year. In 2017, there are no neighborhoods where that is true. Zero. In fact, since 2011, units that are affordable for families making $48,000 a year or less have decreased by almost 50 percent.""
