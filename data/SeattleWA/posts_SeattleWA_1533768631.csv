Hi there!

I've searched through this sub and its wiki and couldn't seem to find what I was looking for, so I figured I'd ask here for advice!

My birthday is at the very end of September, and my boyfriend and I were thinking about taking a trip up to Seattle and Portland (but mostly Seattle) from around **9/27 - 10/1 or 10/2** to celebrate. We live in Los Angeles, and that's typically still in our summer season. I've had birthdays here in the 90-100 degree range with the sun mercilessly beaming down and I HATE it. I'd love nothing more than to have a real autumn birthday. I dream to one day have a birthday where I can be a basic, fall-loving bitch and experience some orange leaves, wear sweaters in chilly weather, and drink coffee that isn't iced. With that being said, during my research, it looks like everything points to September still being summer up there, but it's juuuuuust near the end of the season. I've looked at weather predictions, foliage maps, etc. and have received mixed information across the board for the ideal time for us to visit.

A majority of what I've read states that the wet season begins in October, but since I'm planning on being there pretty much on only the first or second day of the month, do you guys think I could actually get some rain/fog/orange leaves if I take my trip at that time? Would we be too early? Should we hold off for a few weeks, or maybe even a month? Are Seattle and Portland similar in their seasonal changes/is one more ""fall"" than the other?

On the other hand, is the time I'm planning actually the *best* time to visit for good weather (even if it's not autumnal), and I'd end up regretting not going around my birthday week?

I know this is all hard to predict and a lot of factors can play into it each year. Just hoping to hear about what you guys might remember for seasonal weather and foliage changes around this time of year, especially since it's right on the cusp of two very different seasons in the PNW.

If it helps, [this is kinda what I'm talking about](https://imgur.com/a/kJRNqeK) (even though I found these on Google and have no idea where they're actually located lol).

I also know that the east coast is probably better suited for all of this, but I've always wanted to visit the PNW more than anywhere else. :)

My landlord had a pair of sea kayaks she never used, and would let me strap to my crappy old sedan to take to the sound just as long as we operated under the knowledge that if I destroyed it, I'd buy it from her at cost. I grew up running the Rogue, McKenzie, and Deschutes river rapids in kayaks, rafts, and rowing canoes, and didn't have any problem with a sea kayak other than the standard ""Jesus, this thing turns like a cow"" reaction.

Sometimes I go out on the water to make decisions. It's been like that since I was a kid. I grew up on and around water. Major decisions almost always happen in or on water for me; regardless of whether it's sitting in a hot tub, paddling a canoe or kayak through the Minnesota mosquito lakes, standing on a dock, or just riding a ferry from one place to another.

I was considering taking a job offer with a dotcom another friend from college had open up in San Francisco. I had worked at my new job for a grand total of four weeks and I'd signed a year lease with my landlord, but the offer in SF was significantly more money than I was making, and it had a lot more perks (the biggest one being that the company paid for the first six months of rent of a standard 2bd 2ba apartment when relocating people from other states). I needed to make the call by 5pm that day, so I called my boss' voicemail the night before and took a mental health day to work it out.

I took the kayak that fit me (me = the definition of Big &amp; Tall) out around 5am and watched the sun rise over the city from the Sound, with blue sky flooding with yellow dawn light from the middle of the mountains. 

I just hung there on the water, just floating, chewing an energy bar and basking in the dawn. I had a perfect view of the Needle. Nobody was out in the water yet; the first ferry of the day had barely gotten its feet under itself. The water was as smooth as the Sound ever gets at that time of day with almost no wind at all.

I had a sealed flask of hot tea and another of coffee. I was completely blissed out and not paying much attention to anything around me other than the pure view.

Not paying attention to your surroundings? A good half mile from shore? Not the best idea in the world.

I felt a thump on my ass and my heart leapt into my throat.

When I ran whitewater rapids in Oregon a thump of that magnitude on the ass meant that you were in the rocks - you were in a place you REALLY should not be, because you were about to be in a world of uncontrollable hurt. A thump was a warning signal equivalent to ""get your ass out of there, but make sure your helmet is on and your paddle is tied tight, because if you lose either of those you're absolutely screwed.""

I began to shove my paddle into the water in panic when I realized that I was nowhere near any kind of rock, and that the ""rock"" was looking back at me.

I was in the middle of a small pod of orcas, one of which had just nudged my kayak and rolled over to give me the hairy eyeball.

It was this amazing, beautiful dawn moment where I stared eye to eye with this enormous, beautiful, incredibly scary mammal that at a whim could slap my silly human ass into the water, destroy my borrowed kayak, and remind me of exactly why humans have a lot to answer for in regards to centuries of whale hunting and ""delicacies"".

Instead, they all just decided to get a look at me,  and get a good breath out - all  over me and the kayak - before moving off in search of breakfast.

About ten minutes later I paddled my shaky ass back to shore covered in fishy-smelling whale snot.

I called my friend and said I had decided to stay. In retrospect, it was the right thing to do - the dotcom company folded six months later (due in no small part to the incredibly fast burn rate from offering perks like free rent for six months for out of state relocation). 

At the time, though, it was clear my friend thought I was just plain crazy for turning it down. Later that night sitting in my completely crappy overpriced converted studio apartment, I almost called her back and said she was right, that I'd do it.

But I wasn't able to bring myself to pick up the phone and call her to tell her I'd changed my mind.

Multiple mornings, I went back to the same spot several times, hoping to see the pod again, but I never met them again.

I can see why some of the Native American tribes of this area consider them relatives and ancestors and why they are going out to feed the starving mother from J-pod with live Chinook salmon. The moment of eye contact between myself and an orca has been with me. I can clearly see and feel that moment even right now.

That moment began my love affair with Seattle and confirmed that since then, I have never wanted to live in Shoreline, or Everett, or Tacoma, or Bellevue, or Mercer Island.

I've had the chance to move to other cities; even live in other countries. But the 

That moment of humility and terror and beauty and awe was the reason I stayed in Seattle, and that night in August, with my kayaking clothes still reeking of whale snot and stuffed at the bottom of my most impenetrable laundry bag, I had a fair idea that I would never call another city my home.

Three weeks after,  9/11/01 changed the way America looked at itself and at the rest of the world. I listened on the radio and live on the Internet (the IT Department changed its policy on open Internet access for employees very quickly that day).

One month after that, I was called into the office with the rest of the people on the 90-day hiring review and told that ""everyone is okay, you all still have jobs"" - which from a new kid perspective is the writing on the wall to start looking for a new job, stat, but proved to be the case, since I was assigned to work on the problem of making the flight deck secure - or at least as secure as possible within the limits of aluminum and Kevlar reinforcement.

I kept the job. I bought the kayak. I lived in Tangletown for a bit less than three months before my landlady decided she needed the studio for her new weaving hobby. I found a new place in Fremont that didn't wake me up at 4am every morning with the smell of espresso beans being roasted (though dealing with the idiot drunks from the bar scene was always an adventure), and close enough to the Ship canal and marina that I could shove the kayak in for a morning paddle about on Lake Union.

Eventually I sold the kayak, but every so often when I ride the ferry across to Bainbridge or Bremerton, I pass the spot where I had my ass thumped by an orca, and I look back at the city and remember the moment that made me call Seattle home. 

I still get a little misty-eyed if I've been gone for too long and I see the skyline rise as I come north over Beacon Hill to see the city laid out for me, even as I have my daughter singing to herself in the backseat and an ache in my lower back from the long drive home.

I'm not a native Seattleite, but I've lived here longer than I've lived anywhere else. My kid was born at Swedish. I met my wife here long after I thought I had the bachelor life locked in for life. This is my home. For all of its utter dysfunctionality in politics, its expense, its rudeness masquerading as concerned citizenry, its passive aggressiveness, its cranky old people pretending they aren't using Nextdoor as a platform to judge their neighbors worse than the average suburbanite, the homeless, the city council members who promise to be the spearhead of change but once elected show their true colors as part of the machine, the heat, the rain, the crazy-ass hills. I love all of it.

A full list is on http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20180807/ but I will highlight some important and noteworthy races here

##FEDERAL

**[Senator](http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20180807/US-Senator.html)**: Cantwell (inc- D) 59%, Hutchison (R) 23.5%.

As expected, incumbent Maria Cantwell easily won and last-minute former WA GOP Chair Susan Hutchison came in second. What's most noteworthy is that Cantwell is pushing 60% all by herself. This could be a blowout in November.

**[Congressional District 8](http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20180807/CongressionalDistrict8.html)**: Rossi (R) 42.5%, Schrier (D) 19.6%, Rittereiser (D) 16.9%

Dino Rossi easily united GOP voters in the district currently held by retiring GOP Rep Dave Reichert. The 3-way battle for 2nd between Dems is lead by Kim Schrier with Rittereiser on her heels. Combining Schrier, Rittereiser, and 4th-place Hader's votes gives right about 50% and there were a few more minor Dems. This seat looks like it might flip in November.

**[Congressional District 5](http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20180807/CongressionalDistrict5.html)** McMorris Rodgers (inc-R) 54%, Brown (D) 39%

CMR easily clears 50% and the other minor candidates all appear to be Republicans. There has been some chatter about this seat being competitive in November but so far CMR looks pretty safe.

## STATE

**[LD48 Senate](http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20180807/LegislativeDistrict48.html)**: Kuderer (inc-D) 59.3%, Tom (R) 29.8

Rodney Tom still calls himself a Democrat, but he used to hold this seat and crossed the isle to give the GOP majority control of the chamber. Voters in his Bellevue district seem to have remembered and delivered Kuderer, who succeeded him when he retired, a comfortable majority.",False,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,64109,public,self,WA Primary Results,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/95ij55/wa_primary_results/,all_ads,6,,dark,b91a979c-8661-11e6-a38d-0e2ab20e1f97,,,,,,,,,,,,

She sounds like a working class young woman from her AMA and website but this doesn't appear to be 100% true.


She describes herself on her campaign website: ""I am a working-class woman. I live the same life as my constituents; I have to re-balance my finances every year as living gets more expensive. I felt the recession in 2008. My family was forced to move, leaving me on my own at the age of 17, new to Washington state and rapidly building student debt."" (https://www.votesarahsmith.com)


She continuously references her working class roots and job history on her AMA. (Seriously, control f ""working"":  https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/940lug/ama_im_sarah_smith_im_running_for_us_congress_in/?st=jkj8fkg7&amp;sh=242315b9) 


She even dismisses the fact that she now lives outside of the district by saying she was priced out. (https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/94dttj/im_carol_kitty_hafner_democrat_for_alaska_us/e3nvi1n/?context=1&amp;st=jkj9hmc5&amp;sh=43f58b30)


I started looking into it more and it smells like bullshit. No smoking gun or anything, just a feeling that she might be representing her past. According to an interview she did with an admittedly right wing outlet: ""Raised in Southern California, Smith moved to Everett after high school and attended college at the University of Arizona. She currently lives in Kent. Smith worked numerous jobs before taking an interest in politics..."". She also was quoted saying ""I’ve worked a ton of different jobs, I’ve held management positions..."" (http://mynorthwest.com/1066995/sarah-smith-washington-ocasio-cortez/)


So, this working class young woman who was apparently on her own at the age of 17 was able to pay (or get loans for) out of state tuition, and after being only in Washington a few years, lived in Arizona between 2011 and 2014. She then came back and bounced between multiple low to mid level professional jobs (note that these occupations all seem unrelated to each other). Even media coverage glosses over her professional jobs leaving you to assume she is a receptionist at a car dealership instead of a lackey for Geico. So is she ""working class"" or is that just a cute phrase appropriated by a university educated 30 year old who can't hold down a job? There should be nothing embarrassing being middle class, or even low middle class, and not too long ago the working class was the middles class, but she is making it sound like she lives pay check to pay check working in a mine at times. 


And to top it all off, she has spent... what, like six or seven years of her young life in Western Washington with maybe a couple being in or near the 9th? After an out of state meeting with her political group she is taking on the incumbant who happens to have the same name-- I would hazard a guess that was intentional--while accepting primarily out of state donations.

In July we saw 1,470 homes for sale, a 62.8% increase compared to July 2017. We saw 1,047 closed sales, a 4.9% decrease compared to July 2017. Average days on market was 16, a 23.1% increase compared to July 2017. Average sales price was $813,887, an 8.0% increase compared to July 2017.

In other words, the stories you've heard about a flood of inventory on the market are pretty true. The past couple months we've seen a huge increase in listings, so much so that for the first time in a long while there were more homes for sale than homes pended for the month and the average days on market was more than 7. Average sales price is still going up, though. 

The consensus as to why there was a flood of inventory without as many buyers is that the sellers finally decided the market was hot enough for them to sell while buyers decided the interest rates and sales prices were too high for them to buy. Both sides of the market made big decisions at the same time, resulting in a little bit of a halt.

Welcome back to our weekly meetup, 7:30 PM at Elysian Brewery, Pike &amp; 13th! We're in the back, downstairs.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Elysian doesn't close until midnight though so if you like to play late, some of us (like me) might be down.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

Many different sorts of people show up, though male programmers in their mid-20s are common. Women and non-nerds are welcome too! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games^(1,) which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage or snack. Elysian is a public bar/restaurant, which has been very accommodating to our meetup needs, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ

Q: *Does this happen every week?*A: Yes, except for some major holidays, or when The Elysian is closed. I will make a cancellation post in either of those cases.

Q: *Do I have to bring games?*A: Nope! You're welcome to, but feel free to play the games that others and I have brought.

Q: *Is this always at The Elysian?*A: Yes. We've moved around a bit over the years, and Elysian was the best (only?) option for the latest move a few years ago. If you have a different venue in mind, let me know, and I will personally investigate. Keep in mind that we do have very particular needs^(2.) Only Capitol Hill venues will be considered, there are other meetups for other areas.

Q: *Should I order at the bar?*A: Please don't, we have waiter service, and it's already confusing enough with how much we move around the tables.

Q: *Will I be welcome there?*A: Yes, in all likelihood. We take weirdos, normals, all kinds. Just don't be an asshole.

Q: *Can minors attend?*A: Sure, Elysian is all-ages until 11. However, we like to have adult conversations, and occasionally play Cards Against Humanity. If you or yours can't handle that, you might want to stay home.

^(1) *I usually bring Concept, Smallworld, Seven Wonders, Splendor, VivaJave Dice Game, Race for the Galaxy, Codenames, Avalon, Biblios, Timeline, Hanabi, Fluxx, Citadels, Zombie Dice, Love Letter, playing cards and a box of dice.*

^(2) *We have variable attendance, 15-30. We move to different tables a lot. We need wide tables for game boards. We need separate checks. Some people are there for 3 hours and only order 1 iced tea. We want semi-reasonably priced food and drinks.*",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,63974,public,self,Monday Capitol Hill Board Game Night: 7:30 pm at The Elysian,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/94yul6/monday_capitol_hill_board_game_night_730_pm_at/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
