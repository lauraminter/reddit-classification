Worth a read if you want to learn about the area a bit more. 

So much happened here in  the 1800s that I knew very little about. Now as I go around the area, I  have imagery from a forgotten past getting conjured up. Names like  Kitsap, Leschi, Seattle, Boren, Vancouver, Maynard, Denny mean a lot  more to me now. 

Chief Seattle really did found the city,  recruiting Robert Fay to operate a fishery on Elliot Bay which  eventually led to a settlement, town, and now city. Seattle envisioned a  peaceful and harmonious future between his people and the new Changers.  While he was a respected warrior from his past, he played the part of a  peacemaker for many tumultuous decades. To speed this along, he  encouraged native women to marry white men, many of whom actually had  wives back east but didn't mention it until later. 

For a fee of  some blankets and other goods, and for promised protection from the  dreaded slave raids of the Cowichan tribe (and others) on Vancouver  island, the Treaty of Point Elliot was signed in 1855 giving huge  amounts of valuable land away to the European-Americans. The terms were  double-translated through a simple trade language (Chinook Jargon). The  implications were not fully understood. 

In the end it was clear  that there while there was no paradise here before the  European-Americans arrived (no shortage of violence, raids, etc.), the  depopulation, grief, and destitution brought forth by disease, guns, and  forced removal onto reservations was unimaginably tragic. These  people's entire system of wealth was derived from the lands that they  were removed from and lost rights to. At the very very least, we should  grant Federal recognition to the [Duwamish tribe (who now have a  longhouse down by the Duwamish river towards West Seattle)](https://www.duwamishtribe.org/). 

Some  clips from the book below:

&gt;""Simmons  argued that if they owned half, they could not hunt and fish on the  other half, but Hool-hol-tan was adamant: “All the Indians here have  been afraid to talk,” he said, “but I wish to speak and be listened to. I  don’t want to leave my land. It makes me sick to leave it. I don’t want  to go from where I was born.”

&gt;""We will ponder your proposition,  and when we have decided we will tell you. But should we accept it, I  here and now make this the first condition: That we will not be denied  the privilege, without molestation, of visiting at will the graves of  our ancestors and friends. Every part of this country is sacred to my  people. Every hill-side, every valley, every plain and grove has been  hallowed by some fond memory or some sad experience of my tribe.""

&gt; ""the very dust under your feet responds more lovingly to our footsteps  than to yours, because it is the ashes of our ancestors, and our bare  feet are conscious of the sympathetic touch, for the soil is rich with  the life of our kindred.""

&gt;""At night, when the streets of your  cities and villages shall be silent, and you think them deserted, they  will throng with the returning hosts that once filled and still love  this beautiful land. The white man will never be alone. Let him be just  and deal kindly with my people, for the dead are not altogether  powerless.""

&gt;""For the last forty years, the Duwamish and their  tribal chairwoman, Cecile Hansen, have patiently submitted documents  demanded by the federal government for recognition. For a fleeting  moment in 2000, in the waning hours of President Bill Clinton’s  administration, the Department of the Interior finally approved their  petition. But the official responsible did so three days after leaving  office, and incoming George W. Bush officials tabled the petition and  overturned it. Shortly after this profound disappointment, Hansen said,  “It is painful for me, for any Native American to have to prove who they  are.”

Spin has been proud to partner with the City over the last year to pilot shared dockless bikes as another option for getting out of cars and out of traffic. 

&gt;One thing we’ve learned over the last year operating shared bike and e-scooter systems all over the country is that e-scooters provide an even more compelling transportation option than dockless bikes. As we focus in on the ride option that people seem to want most - e-scooters - we’ve made the difficult decision not to apply for Seattle’s new bike-only permit. We look forward to working with Seattle Department of Transportation towards a future e-scooter system. 

&gt;If you have purchased a monthly or annual pass, you will be automatically refunded for the remaining time left on your pass. We’re also refunding account balances - please fill out this short form to get your refund process started. If you have any other questions please feel free to reach out to our team at support@spin.pm.

No matter the neighborhood I have lived in, I always feel like there's a nice park within a short walking distance with all sorts of fun amenities for the family.

I've seen the Reddit Hug of Death do many things, and now there is a call to action for anyone that can help.  Many of you have likely seen the story of missing hiker Sam Sayers.  She went missing August 1st after a solo day hike on Vesper Peak.  The family claims she is an experienced hiker who has done this many times without issue.

Snohomish County has hired SaR teams, flown helicopters (with IR cameras) and brought in K9 teams, but to no avail.  Now, looking to get creative, the family has asked for any experienced drone operators to come help.  The idea is to record as much footage as possible, correlate to GPS and crowd-source footage analysis.  Please note that while they need all the help they can get, this is not a scenario for amateurs.  Vesper Peak has difficult terrain and a volunteer injuring themselves or going missing would only detract from finding Sam.

Sorry about that.

So I've been pretty frustrated with Xfinity (data caps, sporadic connection drops) and Wave (speed nowhere near what was advertised, regular connection drops). When I moved again recently, I initially tried to get Wave again because I love pain, but then I saw that Centurylink was claiming to have 40/100/1000 fiber available in my neighborhood, so I signed up. The installer showed up on time, was nice and competent, and everything worked right away. No contract or introductory rates that then double later. $60/month + $11 for modem rental and it's been great. I only got the 100mb service because I don't need gigabit.

Considering that I live in a sparsely-populated single-family house type of neighborhood, I was surprised that they would run fiber out here, but they sent out the trucks and ran it all the way down the street on the utility poles, since I was the first person to order the service here. I'm surprised and pleased that Centurylink is apparently being aggressively competitive.

This is not a stunning revelation about the Seattle Times editorial board, which has endorsed numerous extreme right-wing candidates in past elections such as Dino Rossi and Jinyoung Englund.
The Seattle Times refusing to join papers across the country in denouncing Trumps attacks on journalists is further evidence that the Seattle Times is nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Earlier this year, The Seattle Times led the effort to spy on the people's legislature by asserting that ""the public"" has the right to read legislator emails and private communications, a bald faced assault on the 1st amendment as no such right exists.
This is nothing but hypocrisy from this right-wing corporation, insisting on the ability to intercept and creepily scrutinize voters thoughts they send to their elected leaders, who just happen to be mostly democrats.
This is textbook example of right-wing playbook fascism , as the state is also led by mostly democrats, the Seattle Times wants to be able to attack progressives, (and so often does publish anti-progressive ""articles"") by wanting the ability to question the most benign voter messages, yet SIMULTANEOUSLY ignore blatant assaults on other journalists.
Its not hard to understand the mindset of the Seattle Times editorial board - and its right-wing executives who are ""OK"" with Trumps behavior, because it fits right with their own, using double standards to further a right-wing anti-American agenda.

So there is this person who I tend to meet every now and then on Westlake avenue. He uses a cane and sleeps there in the night almost every day. Yesterday while I was coming back home I went over to him to give him some food and I saw he has a wound on his face which looked really bad and was painful. I talked to him and he told me he has medicare but it's still gonna cost some to get that fixed. I called the clinic today and they just said he will have to visit the clinic and they need to assess the wound (which is the process). The problem is this person doesn't want to go to Urgent Care and he is super hesitant about  it ( It must not easy for him I guess). What can I do for him? Can I get the billable beforehand maybe and somehow convince him  the doctor will fix it? 

Any kind of help would be appreciated!
