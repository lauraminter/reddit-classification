When there's a heavy cloud layer, it can be especially bad.   


I've read that more efficient routes were researched a few years back that would've minimized noise (and saved on fuel costs) but these plans haven't been implemented.

My name is Simreet and I am a Session Aide for Senator Dhingra. I would like to thank you for engaging in the legislative process and sending us an email concerning marijuana product potency.

In January 2017, the National Academy of Medicine examined 30 years of research and summarized their findings: “The association between cannabis use and development of psychotic disorder is supported by data synthesized in several good quality systematic reviews. The magnitude of this association is moderate to large and appears to be dose dependent.” Exposure of the brain to high potency THC lowers the threshold for developing psychosis, which is what drives the dose dependent correlation between use of highly potent marijuana and psychotic disorders. According to Washington’s Healthy Youth Survey, the vast majority of WA teens are using marijuana acquired through the legal market. Adolescent access would drop off markedly if these extremely high potency THC products were not readily available in stores. 43% of high school seniors in WA have used marijuana at least once. 1 in 4 HS seniors used in the past 30 days and 1 in 10 used ten or more days in the past month. That’s one in ten adolescents who are at significant risk of developing psychotic symptoms due to their heavy use of readily available high potency products. The potency of black-market marijuana in was about 12% by 2014. When voters voted to legalize marijuana, they were likely basing their decision off of their familiarity with marijuana, which was the dried flower with a potency of 2-12%. They likely did not conceive of the creation of concentrated products with a THC level of 80-100%.

You can track this bill here: https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2546&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2019

Please know that I brief the Senator on all matters that constituents reach out about and will definitely pass your opposition to HB 2546 to her.

Best,

Simreet Dhaliwal

Welcome back to our weekly meetup, 7:30 PM at Optimism Brewing, 1158 Broadway. I'll set out board games on one of the tables so you can find us.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

I am a dental hygiene student in Shoreline Community College's Dental Hygiene program. We offer thorough, high-quality care at an affordable price.

I had a **FREE, last minute screening appointment** opening I need to fill: this **Wednesday, 2/5**, check in time **1:00 PM**, with the **appointment going until 2:45 PM** at the latest.  During the screening appointment, patients receive a few initial exams from a dental hygiene student and instructor, as well as a limited exam by the dentist.

During a subsequent appointment, x-rays are taken and comprehensive diagnosis exams are completed. All together, x-rays and comprehensive exams (what we call an Oral Diagnosis appointment) are $35. Once those are complete, we can determine what kind of cleaning is indicated and start on that. Cleanings run between $60-160, depending on the type. We also see children and adolescent patients, although their oral diagnosis and cleaning appointment are usually just 1 appointment.  

We accept Provider One/Apple Care insurance, so if you have that, I believe it covers 1 cleaning/year for adults. But because we're a hygiene school, our exams and cleanings are really inexpensive vs. private dental clinics, so if you don't have dental insurance but are due for an exam and/or cleaning, we're a great place to go! For example, Delta Dental has a tool that estimates the cost for a deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) at $163-336 per 1/4 of a patient's mouth if the patient doesn't have insurance and goes to a private dental practice in the 98133 area code (near our clinic): [https://www.deltadentalwa.com/tools-and-resources/compare-treatment-costs#](https://www.deltadentalwa.com/tools-and-resources/compare-treatment-costs#). Even with insurance, they estimate the same deep cleaning treatment per 1/4 of a patient's mouth at $142-284. In our clinic, a full mouth deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) is $160.

We also have a restorative clinic for low-cost fillings, night guards, and bleach trays (for instance, our night guards are only $125 vs. $600-800 at most private offices). 

If you're interested or know someone who might be, please PM me right way so that I can get you scheduled! OR if you're interested in scheduling a screening on another Wednesday afternoon, PM me. 🙂🦷 Thank you!",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,110854,public,confidence,self,"2/5 FREE Dental Screening, Low Cost Exams, X-Rays &amp; Cleanings!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/exyn19/25_free_dental_screening_low_cost_exams_xrays/,all_ads,6,classifieds,ed4fe802-7a48-11e6-90a8-0e9ca4a99471,Classifieds,,,,,,,,,,
