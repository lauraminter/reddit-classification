Welcome back to our weekly meetup, 7:30 PM at Elysian Brewery, Pike &amp; 13th! We're in the back, downstairs.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Elysian doesn't close until midnight though so if you like to play late, some of us (like me) might be down.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

Many different sorts of people show up, though male programmers in their mid-20s are common. Women and non-nerds are welcome too! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games^1, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage or snack. Elysian is a public bar/restaurant, which has been very accommodating to our meetup needs, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ

Q: *Does this happen every week?*  
A: Yes, except for some major holidays, or when The Elysian is closed. I will make a cancellation post in either of those cases.

Q: *Do I have to bring games?*  
A: Nope! You're welcome to, but feel free to play the games that others and I have brought.

Q: *Is this always at The Elysian?*  
A: Yes. We've moved around a bit over the years, and Elysian was the best (only?) option for the latest move a few years ago. If you have a different venue in mind, let me know, and I will personally investigate. Keep in mind that we do have very particular needs^2. Only Capitol Hill venues will be considered, there are other meetups for other areas.

Q: *Should I order at the bar?*  
A: Please don't, we have waiter service, and it's already confusing enough with how much we move around the tables.

Q: *Will I be welcome there?*  
A: Yes, in all likelihood. We take weirdos, normals, all kinds. Just don't be an asshole.

Q: *Can minors attend?*  
A: Sure, Elysian is all-ages until 11. However, we like to have adult conversations, and occasionally play Cards Against Humanity. If you or yours can't handle that, you might want to stay home.

Before I tell you about my story I want to tell you about myself and what kind of person I am. I have worked since I was fifteen. At the age of seventeen I wanted to serve my country so I joined the navy and soon after the Special Forces. I was a body builder who worked out daily. I was six feet two inches tall and two hundred twelve pounds at the time of injury. I am married with two children. My wife is a type one diabetic and unable to work. My family depended on me solely to provide health insurance and income. I had been working as a security installer for sixteen years and worked more than fifty hours every week. Sometimes seven days a week with forced overtime but there was no question that providing for my family came first.

I had been working for ADT as an installer for seven years. The job required me to be a low voltage electrician of journey level. My job was considered to be in a heavy physical category. I ran wire through tight areas like attics and crawl spaces. I often carried 75lb spools of wire and my 52lb 24ft fiberglass ladder. This was pretty typical for an electrician. The job required I crawl through fiber glass, dirt, dust, animal dropping, and on a few occasions water to complete assignments. In April of 2008 I was assigned a residential installation. I arrived at the residents and looked over the house to determine what had to be accessed for the wiring. The house was on a slab, so no crawl access. The attic hatch was in the garage. This garage had been converted into a man cave. The attic access was relocated to an outer wall. Not typical for the hatch to be there. I set up my six foot A-frame ladder below the hatch. I removed the cover and saw the roof slope facing me. I climbed further up the ladder. As I did I flipped around and sat down on the edge of the hatch. I immediately felt intense pain shoot into my upper back. I jerked forward from the pain. I turned and saw two bloody framing nails. Getting scratched or poked is common in my line of work. My ear was even caught by a nail on one job but I bandaged it up and finished my tasks. So I didn’t think much of this incident and finished the job.

The next morning I had a tingle in my neck. I went to work with discomfort but no pain. The second morning went dramatically different. I was in intense pain and could no longer look up or raise my right arm. I called in sick and made an appointment with my doctor. I had no idea what was going on. I saw my primary care physician. He told me I probably pulled a shoulder muscle and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed nothing wrong. I worked in pain for five more months and taking ibuprofen like candy just so I could keep working.

I finally saw a chiropractor to see if I could get help for the pain. He told me it was not a muscle issue and that I was seriously injured. He ordered my first MRI of my C - spine. I could not lay still for that MRI. It was extremely painful and the physicians were not authorized to give me medication because a chiropractor had ordered it. I reported my injury to the department on September 2nd of 2008. The department’s doctor ordered a new MRI. This time I was given 100mg Demerol and 5mg valium even then I could barely hold still. The MRI was completed and showed that I had blown out my C6 - C7 disc and was bulging at my C5 - C6 disc. The rupture was so large that Dr. Brown, my neurological surgeon, said I had no choice other than surgery.

I received a notice from my employer that I would have to pay more for my healthcare. I contacted my claims manager. I told him how important it was that I have healthcare for my wife’s medical condition. The department withheld money due for my healthcare for four months and I lost my healthcare for 18 months. This was my worst fear. I later received a letter from my new claims manager where she apologized for this happening. I talked to him again to ask why he had purposely stopped my healthcare and he said that he was sorry and that his manager had told him to do this to me. This is when I learned that LNI was not really trying to help me.

In October of 2008 Dr. Brown did a fusion through the front of my neck. When my wife tried to fill my pain medication prescription on our way home it was denied by the department and for the first twenty-four hours after surgery I went without pain medication. I went through rehabilitation but I didn’t go to regular rehabilitation. Since I had a heavy job physically I was placed directly into work conditioning. I got through that and was placed into work hardening. During the final days of therapy something didn’t feel right with my neck and I started having more frequent muscle spasms. I felt like it had flexed somehow when lifting weights, which was part of work hardening.

I was sent back to the same job with no restrictions. I lasted two days. The second day I was helping another tech with his install. I went to drill the top of a window frame in a garage for a contact. I was using a cordless drill with a six foot 3/8th bit. When you drill a door or window there is always a six inch piece of wood called a header. Our bits were very dull from hitting nails constantly. I had to place the drill low and push up with a good amount of strength. I felt again my neck flexing followed by intense pain. I called my supervisor and went home. I contacted Dr. Liskey, my LNI doctor and the department.

During this time the department was trying to close my claim. I couldn’t work anymore and they refused to pay for time lost for twenty-three days. They were trying to starve me and my family so that I would go back to work and I just couldn’t do it. I soon saw Dr. Brown, who did the surgery on my C6 - C7 herniation. At my appointment he was not happy to see me. His attitude was that his surgery could be nothing but perfect. He acted like it was in my mind. I never complained about anything else but my neck. In his report he tries to blame my problems on anything but his work even using the word etcetera. He denied any further appointments with me.

I soon had another appointment with a different surgeon. During my appointment Dr. Nehls explained that the bone graph that was to stabilize me did not take. He said if I wanted to get back to work another fusion through the back would stabilize me the most. I had a second fusion on C6 - C7 through the back this time. The day after the surgery my wound started leaking a lot after opening a sliding glass door. I went to the emergency room and they called Dr. Nelhs in to see me. My wound was filled with fluid. They put me on a rolling bed and put me in the back of the ER. Dr. Nehls arrived upset. He didn’t wash his hands or put gloves on. Right there he ripped off every closure on my wound. He acted like I had ruined his work. He then told a nurse to clean me up and get ready to go back in. I was admitted to the hospital and soon after developed an infection. I spent a week on Demerol and IV antibiotics. My wound never closed. The infection ate the muscle that helps hold my head up. After recovering I was soon back at work conditioning. Then work hardening. I felt really good this time.

My doctor told me that he didn’t think I was going back to my same job. He said that he was waiting for the physical capacity evaluation from my rehabilitation provider. The report stated I could work a light to medium job physically. ADT Corporate sent over a bogus job analysis report that didn’t accurately reflect my heavy job. I went to my supervisor and he gave me the JA (job analysis) for my job that he used to screen new applicants. The JA referenced a heavy job. I tried to fix this through ADT and LNI but my efforts were shut down. The department was made fully aware of this false JA.

I was sent back to a heavy job with no restrictions. I have both JA forms still; the JA forged to put me back to work and the JA that actually reflected my job. My surgeons had both told me if I was sent back the strain on my back would blow out the next disc. I was released May in of 2010 again with no restrictions.

I complained to my supervisor that I needed another tech to assist me on heavy crawl jobs. He did at first but then stopped. I tried to avoid small spaces but this was part of the job. In December of 2011 I was given a small business job. The job was about thirty miles from the Tacoma office, in Yelm, Washington. I arrived and looked over the building. The job was a simple; two doors, a keypad, a motion, and a control panel to be wired. It was sold as a hardwired because the sales person saw a roof hatch. The roof was flat which was a bad sign. I set up my ladder and popped the hatch to the side. There was only two feet of attic space with steel trusses in a zig-zaging pattern.

I immediately called my supervisor. I told him the situation and suggested going wireless on the system. I told him I couldn’t crawl the space. He said that I was too far from the office to go back to get wireless parts and that they could not send anyone with the parts either. He said if I could not do the job as sold, to go home, that there was no other work for me. I could not afford to lose a day’s pay. I crawled the attic by pulling myself along with my arms using the trusses. I couldn’t really move my legs. I made it the twenty feet to the front door. I grabbed the wire and tried to turn around but had trouble doing so. There was no room. I forced my body around and felt a pop. I felt pain in my shoulder intense at first then less after I had straightened out. I finished the job. The next morning my shoulder had gotten worse. There was a tingle in my neck. I called in sick. The next day I couldn’t look up and lift my left arm at the same time. I made a doctor’s appointment. The pain was mostly in my shoulder so she sent me to a shoulder doctor and ordered some test x-ray or ct. At the appointment with Dr. Anderson, he said the imaging showed no damage to my shoulder and wanted a MRI of my shoulder. The medical co-pay was $600 for the MRI. I couldn’t have it done because of the cost.

I didn’t want to go back on LNI because they had done so many bad things to me. I took a lot of Ibuprofen to get by and suffered permanent kidney damage from it. I used fourteen vacation days, four floating holidays, and three sick days over the next six months. ADT changed my work shift by one hour because of my “bad attitude” but I know it was because of my claim. I was passed up on two promotions because of my workers comp claim also. I was the senior journeyman electrician in the shop. I was the golden boy before my injuries always getting the job done with quality work. Now I felt that they were trying to get rid of me. I knew deep down that no other company was going to hire me with all of this metal holding my head on. I was in an electrical union so I became a shop steward to avoid being terminated for my injuries.

While working one day I had to take down my 52lb twenty four foot fiberglass ladder. My full sized van was not equipped with a ladder loader. The ladder was the final straw. I couldn’t work with this pain anymore. I tried for eleven months. My family had been trying to get me to stop working and take care of my injury. The constant pain had changed me into someone I wasn’t. The military trained me that I had no limits but I was broken physically and mentally by this time.

Reluctantly I reported my injury to LNI in November of 2012. I was confused why it was a re-opening, since I had a new injury. My claims manager took seventy-four days before reopening my claim. At the time I was hurt and couldn’t really fight for myself. I signed a release of my medical records showing my treatment for my work related injury with my family doctor and whoever else treated me but the department did not put the records into my claim. I faxed them into my claim file in May of 2018.

Dr. Lim my LNI doctor didn’t think I was hurt after I told him how long I had been injured. He didn’t believe someone could keep working with an injury. He kept sending me back to work. My last day worked was December 24th of 2012 and I lasted three hours at a desk job. When the MRI came back it showed a new C5 - C6 herniation. It was exactly what my surgeons said would happen due to stress on my spine. The department knew of this new injury but re-opened my original claim. Dr. Lim and I had a falling out. I didn’t want a doctor that did not believe me and mishandled how my claim was opened.

I soon had an appointment with Dr. Nehls. He was the surgeon who opened my wound up in the ER. He didn’t have the guts to face me and I saw a junior surgeon. He wanted to rush into surgery, it would be my third go at surgery and I wanted to try anything besides surgery. I wanted to try an epidural shot first. I underwent the procedure but it made my pain worse. The technician said he had to shoot me low at my T1 - C7 instead of C5 - C6. My entire back was lit up. During this time I had to make a choice of keeping my healthcare or paying my mortgage. I choose health care because of my wife’s type one diabetes. Our savings had disappeared quickly and we lost our home. I was forced to move to California and in with my parents.

The department’s website for doctors was deeply flawed and filled with mistakes. I was seen at a clinic for pain management and certification of inability to work. My Claims manager at the time told me that it was my fault for leaving Washington State; that they had no doctors in California. My mother told me of Dr. Sall who accepted LNI patients and had treated my father. I began seeing Dr. Sall in July of 2013 and our relationship began. Dr. Sall ordered tests and referrals to both a gastro and spine surgeon. Dr. Sall said my case was complicated and wanted me to be seen at UCLA medical center in Los Angles.

It took ten months before I could see a new surgeon for my C5 - C6 herniation. Dr. McBride required a new MRI since my last one was over six months old. When I finally got to my appointment he came in with a junior surgeon. He explained to me and my wife my present condition. He said that surgery was not an option at this time. He told me that my body had tried to heal itself and the disk material was removed by my body. He also stated that because of my age and how far up my injury was that he didn’t want to do more harm. He said that I would be left with instability in my neck. I asked if there was anything I could do to help with the pain. He told me to wear a C-collar and stay as active as I could. He said if my condition deteriorated further that he would consider surgery as an option.

After surgery was no longer an option things changed with my case. Dr. Sall requested physical therapy and pain management, but I received neither. All curative treatment stopped. Dr. Sall was prescribing muscle relaxers, pain medication at this time to help with mobility and quality of life. LNI at this time stopped paying for my lyrica and norco that I used to manage my pain. I managed to get the VA to cover my lyrica and started paying out of pocket for my norco. I have had to pay for my own pain medication for over four years now.

The department either denied or just did not respond to any of Dr. Sall’s requests for tests or treatments. He then had an in house functional capacity evaluation (FCE) done at his practice. I had not worked in two years. I had not received any curative treatment for my C5 - C6 injury. At the first FCE my blood pressure was too high due to pain despite me taking blood pressure medication. At the second FCE I was worked up to a 30lb two-hand carry. On the turnaround I almost fell due to a spasm in my lower back. The guy doing the testing grabbed the basket from me and the FCE was never completed.

The next morning my left ass cheek was throbbing with pain. It felt as though I had been kicked by a bull. I couldn’t get out of bed without the help of my wife. I reported this to Dr. Sall. He said that maybe my bio-mechanics were to blame. Since there was no medical intervention my injury caused my left shoulder to pull upward and push my neck forward and to the right, disfiguring me. I found out later through the VA’s imaging that I have two herniated discs in my lower back, two herniated discs in my middle back and my neck is unstable. I reported these to the department and faxed in the VA reports. The department assigned a company named Genex to find out why my care had stalled. Dr. McBride and Dr. Sall both had ordered a TENS unit to help manage my pain. I received one at Dr. Sall’s request but it had no instructions and was repossessed from me within a month of receiving it because L&amp;I would not pay for it. The final report from Genex indicates as of 12-27-2014 that I was awaiting vocational assessment and was MMI. In January of 2015 my diagnosis changed;

From:

(1) - S/P Cervical Fusion

(2) - HNP C5-6 Nerve Root Impingement

(3) - Esophageal Stricture secondary to 1

(4) - S/P Redo Posterior Surgery C6-7

To:

(1) - Esophageal Reflux

(2) - Displacement of the Lumbar Intervertebral Disc

(3) - Aftercare following surgery for injury

I contacted Dr. Sall and he had no idea how the diagnosis had changed. The medical reports submitted by Dr. Sall say nothing of these changes. -At the time I was fighting the department for stopping my time loss. Somehow Dr. Sall’s paperwork indicated that I was released to go back to work without restrictions. Also Dr. Sall didn’t know that this had happened.

The department charged in and had an IME to address these new conditions. I contacted the department pointing out that these were not correct. The IME was scheduled in February of 2016. The IME, vocational report, and Dr. Sall’s rating concluded that I could not be gainfully employed. I was by definition eligible for a pension. The department failed to make a decision and again I was left at the wayside.

That is how LNI works; they can change anything, stop time loss, and never give an official decision on paper. You have to appeal through The Board of Industrial Appeals a decision that’s not on paper. The Board of Industrial Appeals makes them put it on paper or stop what they are doing.

On March 16, 2017 The Departmant of Labor and Industries sent me a letter and the final vocational report. That says You are no longer required to participate in our vocational assessmet. This is because I have learned that due to your injury further services are unlikely to help you return to work. I will continue to monitor your entitlement to these benefits and let you know if there are any changes.

The department waited until September of 2017 to perform another IME for the same conditions. Even though the IME was for the same conditions as before the department also changed what type of specialists that examine each condition. This sorta seems like Dr. Shopping. The 2016 IME’s specialist requirements are as follows: Orthopedic surgery, Neurology, Gastroenterology, and General surgery. The 2017 IME’s specialist requirements were: Orthopedic surgery, Gastroenterology, Vascular surgery, and Neurological surgery. I have met my share of surgeons and most care about one thing, can they perform surgery or not. They do not treat chronic conditions.

The IME came back saying that I can be gainfully employed and that my C5 - C6 injury was pre-existing. Pre-existing to what? The department’s site also indicated that Dr. Sall was sent the IME and response letter but he never received these documents. I contacted my claims manager and he is resending them. The last IME doctors took one hundred eighty two days to complete the 2017 IME. They are giving Dr. Sall only fourteen days to respond.

So this is what happened to me. It is all in my file and it’s huge. There is so much more to say. I lost a career I loved, the home our family shared for twenty years, and my health. LNI and ADT set me up to fail because they did not want to take responsibility for my injuries. My health was never a priority for either of them. I am 54 and my father can run circles around me at 78.

Due to my work injuries I do nothing but toss and turn in my sleep for the past ten years. I wake up in pain every day. If you are hurt in Washington beware and watch your site close because they will toss you out like trash and let Social Security take responsibility for L&amp;I ‘s actions. There is so much more that was done and is still being done to me by The department of Labor and Industries.

We will have the fire pit lit, and the trampoline open, and we may also have the climbing chimney open as well as the inside climbing wall, and Jade (a former housemate) has said that she will be on hand to give tours of the house to reveal all the secrets hidden inside.  and there are a few new small ones since last time.


June 23rd (Saturday) at 3:00PM (of course you can come early - but the price will be that you will have to help set things up...) at the Dragon House on the corner of 44th and Brandon, and you can't miss the place, there is, well, a Dragon on the corner.  If you need the legitimate address, it's 5284 44th Ave SW.

As far as the potluck.   We here at the Dragon House believe in having a civilized gathering of folks, so I will happily be providing proper silverware and plates at this event.   What does it mean to be civilized - other than not eating off throwaway plates and utensils?  It's a ""Leave no Trace"" philosophy, like in the burning Man community...  and that means:  Wash your dishes when you are done gorging yourself on the yummies that are here.

As far as food?  Lets try this as a construct... Try to ""win"" the potluck.  My definition of winning is bringing something so compelling that it gets gobbled up first.  Now I'd like to note this is not about spending a million hours preparing something - though you are free to do so, and it's also not about spending loads of money on something to share (though again, you are free to do so), it's about putting some thought into something you want to share with everyone.  It's about NOT running late and buying a random bag of lays chips on the way here.  It's about wanting people to seek you out to talk about how wonderful the thing you brought is.   Set the bar there, and we will all be able to gorge ourselves on the most amazing bounty of yumminess you can imagine.

I invite people from a number of groups tothese potlucks, so there is a wide variety of folks here, and it's always a most interesting time with great conversation to be had.



If anyone has trouble finding the place, please just give me a ring at (206) 932-6622.


Since there is a trampoline in play, I should share with you the Trampoline rules.  There are three:
 
1: No shoes, sharp things or bodily fluids on the trampoline.  If you need to barf after spinning round in the air too many times - get off it first.

2: No getting hurt.  Octagons have GREAT positional control, so there is no excuse for bouncing off the side of the trampoline and breaking your pointy little head... or other body parts.

3: Don't be a dick.  You do NOT get to climb on the trampoline and double bounce someone unless they invite you to.  Any non-consensual bouncing will lead to being banned from the trampoline.



So, some one, come all, bring partners, family, coworkers and friends, bring your kids, and I hope to see you all here.

2) How sketchy is the area near the Space Needle? I booked rooms at the Mediterranean Inn located close by and am wondering if it safe to walk on foot with people who are unaccustomed to be accosted by the homeless. Is the monorail/ Lightrail/bus safe to take at night, or is ubering around the best option?

Bernie Utz is a Seattle institution, in the same vein as Leroy Menswear. While my fondness for Leroy largely stemmed from my mid 90s high school fascination with all things pimp, I never actually patronized Leroy, largely due to a girlfriend enforced ban on purple tuxedos for prom. RIP Leroy.

Bernie Utz, by contrast, is a fashion partner most men can use. It's a classy store, run by very classy folks, and I'd strongly encourage everyone to get in and see what a sharp kid can do for you with the dollface ladies (going for a noir thing here). The saddest part is they still sell 200 hats per day, according to the article. Clearly a viable business. I'll be making a trip from Portland to grab a couple hats and tip my brim.

A Prius was merging on I-405 when they decided that they no longer wanted to and literally put it in reverse, turned 90 degrees were sideways in the off ramp, waiting to pull back out in I-5 traffic. 

Today I've seen two cars that were on I-5 northbound in the HOV lane suddenly dart across 4 lanes of traffic to make the off ramp at different times during the morning rush.

I'm begging you, please stop being selfish on the road. Not only are you putting your life in danger, but you are also putting the lives of others in danger. Children will deprived of parents for the rest of their lives over selfish acts just to shave a minute or two off of your already brutal commute, it's just not worth it.

I, like most of us, want a clean city where I can feel safe to live with my family, and be surrounded by fellow Seattlites who DESERVE to be here due to the sweat on their back.

I get a lot of backlash when talking about creating a program to remove the homeless population, but I think I've got a long term solution that will bring great benefit to the city.  First, we should develop specific districts with jobs available, each corresponding to an identified need from the city.  Then, upon removing the homeless they can be placed in each corresponding district and have an immediate economic opportunity, while creating great benefit for the continual safe growth of Seattle.

Now, the issue I hear the most is, ""how do we KEEP the homeless out of the city after the initial sweeps.""  I get that this is tough, so it seems to me that the only solution is to build some kind of barrier or wall around the city, increasing safety to all those inside and only allowing CITIZENS into the bounds.  We already have natural walls with the lakes and ocean, so it's not even that drastic a proposition, but one that would cost less then a infinite money suck of ""homeless support systems.""

Heck, we can even create a system where each district - probably through a lottery system - can have the opportunity to send one citizen into Seattle for a few months, with the possibility of staying if they prove themselves.  Personally, I'm thinking a massive brawl between each of the district representatives in the Amazon Spheres that we can bet on, and the winner can get an apartment and free Amazon Prime in one of the new towers.

Not exactly fair, since I didn't claim to know the answers but just wanted to say that I have practical and moral objections to encouraging police to go around rounding people up.  I don't think that's an effective or just solution to homelessness.  But fine, I give it my best as an airchair policy maker:

As I see it, **anti-homelessness efforts are fractured and there's no coordination**.  There's lots of money being spent by various agencies and non-profits, but little idea what is working and what is not.  In addition, there's a gap between interventions on the ground and the City Council.  Laws that could change to help ease the problem are not changed because the Council doesn't know that such a change would be helpful to a solution that works.  Thus the Council is locked in a place where it doesn't what to do, and effective solutions on the ground are not enabled.

I've talk a ton to various people on this sub about what the root cause of homelessness is in Seattle.  My personal interpretation is that it's a byproduct of the increased cost of living.  Some people disagree with me and argue it's the opiod crisis or mental health.  Regardless if you think the **root cause is cost of living, drugs, or mental health**, I believe that the homeless are a diverse enough group to warrant a variety of solutions.

To that end, I would probably **establish an Office of Homeless Affairs** (""OHA""), and adequately fund it.  The existing Office of Housing has a more narrow mandate on creating and maintaining affordable housing that I think is inadequate to solve this problem.  A new office would given funding to run its own anti-homeless programs or partner with other organizations and offices for such programs, so long as they focus on the three ""root causes"" identified above using a results-based system.  This means that funding from this office has **time limits, upper and lower funding limits, and evaluation criteria**.  Any program funded in part by OHA would need to provide evaluation criteria.

This matters because then we can start identifying valuable programs without defunding existing work.  Defunding existing work is fraught with political difficulties (which is why the Council to this date has not implemented robust auditing), but providing new funding with strings attached is easier.  To fund this office, as the head tax is off the table as well as more equitable income tax, I'd probably have the city **issue a bond**, assuming it has the power to do so.  While this puts other things in the General Fund at risk, tackling homelessness sooner rather than later is probably worth it, and hopefully this will buy us the time to phase out support for older programs with less auditing which may be more wasteful.

The OHA can also start to serve as a **clearinghouse for developing legislation and coordinating** with other cities.  We should re-prioritize the One Table initiative with the goal of putting OHA in a leading role.  We should move forward with One Table even if some nearby municipalities don't want to participate.  In addition, I would, at least temporarily, allow the OHA to directly propose changes to the city code and ordinances to the Council and obligate them to vote on these changes.  This would hold the Council's feet to the fire for less politically easy changes (like zoning) or perhaps expedite simple things that might otherwise get overlooked (like, I dunno, allowing soup kitchen vehicles to use bus lanes, if that helped).

In this process, you're going to have a ton of imperfect solutions, and since the homeless are not a homogeneous group, **we need a lot of different imperfect solutions**.  Thus, ""the solution"" as it were, I think is a) proper funding, and b) to come up with a well-oiled machine for quickly running through the various potential solutions and weeding out the bad ones and growing the effective ones.

Again, I haven't been involved in government (at any level) nor really have a deep understanding of how shit works in City Hall.  Perhaps I'm just super naive.  Also, some of you have clearly made up your minds and anything I say is unlikely to change that, but I do believe that putting something like this out there might be helpful and maybe push the conversation in a constructive direction.

After the walk through he said he was going to take out 75 dollars for carpet cleaning but other then that the house looked great; then wrote a check to my other 2 roommates for 625 dollars (i was at work).  After 12 days of not getting my check it finally arrived after hounding him with texts; but it was for 525 dollars.  I've texted him numerous times asking if he was going to send the other 100 dollars but he never responds.  Is there some sort of legal grounds to look into to get my money/sue the estate or is it a waste of my time (i never deposited the check because i figured it was a way for him to say ""no i paid him, see"")?  

I grew up in West Seattle in the 90's around High Point/Delridge and White Center so my first instincts were ""this idiots got a family and sent me a check with his address on it, time to show up"" but being an adult i feel like it's the wrong way to handle things.  Although if the consensus is it's a waste of my time and i'm going to be living 3 minutes from his house and still might stroll down to ask him/his family why I didn't receive my owed money.  

Interested to hear back from other stories or suggestions/advice. 
It's really a bummer when you act responsibly and another grown man who even has a family can't even respond to a text message explaining things.  Especially in times where it's so hard to find a decent rental.
