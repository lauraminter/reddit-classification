I'm wasn't able to find a specific subreddit for moving to the area so I'm hoping this is okay.

I am currently living in Arizona and am being considered for a job as a construction engineer right out of college in the Seattle area. The company is flying me out to for a third interview soon and the possibility of a job offer is getting more and more likely. I really do like this job, I haven't had much luck in the local job market, and I have always wanted to live in Seattle so it seems like a dream opportunity for me but I also need to be realistic.

The average entry-level salary for this position is somewhere in the low $60k range before taxes nationwide but then again, I'm exactly not sure how much of a difference the no income tax in Washington state makes. 

Looking at places to live in the area has scared me off a bit. The job is in the Redmond area but after doing research, there's obviously no way I can afford that and I really don't have any problem with a 30+ minute commute as long as I'm living somewhere comfortable. I'd much prefer to have my own small place after having to room with people for 4 years while in school but I have to consider if having roommates would be a better option. The only places I can really afford in the city are in the low $1,000/month range and they all seem to be sub-300 sq ft. microapartments with only an microwave and minifridge which may not be ideal but by no means a complete dealbreaker. I think I'd prefer to live in the city but if anyone can suggest a nice suburb with slightly lower rent and plenty of stuff to do for a single 20-something I'd love that. 

Here's some idea of where I stand. I don't have a car payment (but I do own a low maintenance, fuel-efficient car), I owe less than $1,000 in credit cards, and around $12,000 in student loans. I think I would like to be able to have a real social life, go out to bars/social events every once in a while, and eat out a couple times a week while not having to live paycheck-to-paycheck.

Sorry for the long, overly detailed post. I guess what I really want to know is if I can afford to live there. I've made a hypothetical budget and my monthly expenses would probably be around $2,700 and I'd probably bring home around $4,000 a month after taxes and deductions but something tells me that my expenses are way too low. Maybe I'm overthinking but I don't want to make a stupid mistake by moving out there and struggling to find financial security. Or maybe I fuck up the interview and don't get the job lol.

I live in a condo and our mail boxes are in our building lobby, which can be easily viewed by anyone in the building as well as through large windows facing the street. Once in a blue moon our building is broken into and packages left in the lobby are stolen. (The mail man usually leaves them in the open and all the building residents are respectful of each other.)

Today I got home and noticed a ballot envelop unopened sitting on the table next to the window in the lobby. I thought maybe the wrong resident received it but somehow wasn’t concerned enough to deliver it to their neighbor and instead left it here for them to find. I went to deliver it but reading it closer, the address is for a different set of condos down the block (same street, wrong house number.)

If this was junk mail, I wouldn’t care. But voting is important so I’m going to take this to the right address tomorrow. 

However, my concern is, especially since this is a ballot addressed to someone, and especially since our mail boxes/lobby is so open to passerby’s who have broken in before, is there someone I should be reporting this to? Should I file a complaint about incorrectly mailed ballots? To who? USPS? The people in charge of ballot mailing and receiving? I’d be extremely upset if I found out my ballot was sent to not me and I never received it. I would be worried someone voted in my place.

Should I take some other more official route to get it to its correct home? We have a mail drop box in our lobby for outgoing mail (under lock by USPS)—should I place it there instead and let it get reprocessed? I found it on the table, so someone obviously didn’t think they should put it in the outgoing mail box. I figured it’d be faster to deliver it myself, but I hope I’m not infringing on any unique Washington law about handling someone’s (unopened) ballot.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,62990,public,self,Someone’s ballot was incorrectly delivered to my building.,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/914r07/someones_ballot_was_incorrectly_delivered_to_my/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 I love the idea of having artists in and a big party in the neighborhood, but goddamn. Not being able to get into your normal spots to have a drink and slice of pizza because all sorts of fat bros and suburban migrants coming in to pay 75 bucks to get shitfaced are invading is fucking depressing.

Could we at least keep the neighborhood spots open so the locals can go to their local joints on days they're not attending because they have to work?

I placed an order last Saturday for some bike tires since mine were worn bald. The tires came with free shipping scheduled for 7/25 but a $10 add on option gave me a delivery time of 7/20, aka tonight. Last night I got an email the tires were being shipped and thought oh no... Sure enough tonight they weren't here. I tracked them and they haven't even gotten into Fedex yet.

Called customer service, they tell me we have to ask if the seller is willing to refund the extra $10 for shipping and wait 3 business days for a reply which is bullshit because it was their website that offered me Friday delivery. Apparently after I checked out they sent me a confirmation email with a delivery date range instead of the hard date I paid for. I never read that email until tonight so I missed that little changeup when it happened.

The CSRs kept pointing to the date range in the confirmation email and I asked them why I would pay an extra $10 shipping on a free shipping item if it meant the item might still arrive on the 25th? None would venture an answer. They transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who spoke broken English I could hardly understand, who told me she was refunding the money to me herself but then I got an email from her asking the seller to refund the money instead, so now I feel like they conned me to get off the phone.

I explained to them that I viewed the item on Amazon.com, Amazon.com offered me the expedited shipping option, and then Amazon.com took my money. How can they now claim that I have to negotiate a refund with some people I've never even heard of before? I don't understand why they'd risk losing a 15 year customer who orders several thousand dollars worth of stuff each year over $10 in legitimately botched shipping. Hell tomorrow I'm supposed to sign for a $1300 order and I'm tempted to decline delivery and order it elsewhere just for spite before I cancel my membership. I can even charge it back with my credit card if the seller says no, so I just don't understand why they're wasting my time like this.
