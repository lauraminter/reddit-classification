I witnessed a woman on the bus today overdose and have a seizure. 

I could hear screaming from over the music through my headphones, and when I peeked around a couple of the chairs I saw her flailing on the ground seizing and foaming at the mouth. 

I looked around at the passengers, and everybody's eyes were on her, but nobody moved. 

Not shocking, but still conclusively disheartening. 

Obviously I left all of my belongings in my seat and ran to assist her, turning her on her side and sitting beside her shaking body just waiting for the seizure to end. 

There were needles scattered amongst all of her belongings on the bus floor, and I could almost feel the disgusted penetrating stares of the bus-goers around us. Nobody gave a fuck if this woman dropped dead in that moment. They looked more annoyed that she was causing a scene than scared that they were going to watch a fucking human being die.

She finally stopped seizing and I snapped a few times in her face, asking her the year, who the president was, her name, etc. And it didn't even occur to me that I was sitting in her piss. That was until she vomited on me and I looked down at the ground to see the mess that I was sitting in. 

The minute that ""Ambulance"" was spoken she quickly gathered her things, despite me tugging on her arm and begging her to stay. I offered her all of the money in my wallet to just stay until the ambulance came, but she ran off the bus before they could arrive. 

After she ran away, I had to get off the bus, and let me tell you: I don't think I've had a panic attack that frightening ever. 

To the point where I can't even fucking stand, I have to sit down on the street to catch my breath, and I can't even see through the tears, all of my limbs and face went numb, and I don't even remember walking into work before they sent me home. 

Typically I wouldn't come to facebook to spew my guts about shit like this, but after having a friend of mine die this past weekend of an overdose, this interaction shook me to my core. All I could do was imagine my friend in the same position as her, but in his instance, no fingers were snapped in his face, and he was not granted the privilege of reciting what year it was. 

Experiencing this shit firsthand really put in perspective a lot of things. 

Like, for instance

1- IF YOU SEE SOMEONE ANYWHERE OVERDOSING, DON'T JUST FUCKING SIT THERE. I DON'T CARE HOW STRUNG OUT THEY LOOK. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SUPER IMPORTANT SNAPCHAT. GET YOUR ASS UP AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

2- This epidemic is out of fucking control. After the bus left and I was sitting on the street, and she walked up and sat down next to me, sobbing uncontrollably. I offered her a cigarette, and she told me that she had been in the hospital the night before, and that she had asked to go to detox and that they DENIED HER. THIS FUCKING WOMAN COULD HAVE HAD THAT SEIZURE IN A HOSPITAL BED SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE HELPED HER, BUT INSTEAD SHE WAS LEFT IN THE HANDS OF A 22 YEAR OLD THAT BARELY KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK SHE'S DOING BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. 

3- The state of this crisis is far worse than I ever thought possible. I have seen people shooting up on the streets, I've seen the aftermath of people who are too fucked out of their minds to walk, and of course, as any person who takes a bus can tell you, I've seen people sleeping on the bus. But I've never been soaked in the vomit of a woman who begged to go to detox and was denied because she couldn't AFFORD to get clean.

 4- People I fucking know are going through this, or will go through this in the future, and chances are I'm not going to be able to be there to help them. 

I'm just a 22 year old fuck up--A product of misplaced thoughts and good intentions--and I have no fucking clue where to start with these issues. But I know that what happened today will never fucking leave me, and that if she had gotten the proper care, I would be at work right now and I would have never known the horrors of what I witnessed today. I will never forget Alex crying and begging to hold my hand on a street corner because I'm the first person she's met in years that took the time to listen to her--especially after she had dumped her fucking fluids all over me--I will never fucking forget the way her lifeless body lay on that fucking bus floor, or the way that the tears spilled down my face as I wondered if I would even get the chance to ask her who the fucking president was.

The bar was pretty busy, so I was surprised to see someone with a full sized Rottweiler (prob 100 lbs) on a leash.

In the bathroom, I said to my bf, ""since when was it ok to bring a Rottweiler to a bar?"" And, *of course,* there were two guys in the bathroom who identified as friends of the dog owner. ""I knew it was a bad idea,"" one of them said.

I hoped the situation was over at that. But when I left the bathroom, the dog owner approached me and politely but firmly asked, ""I just wanted to know what issue you had against my dog?"" (paraphrasing)

I said, ""you're imposing on everyone here. You don't see everyone else with a dog."" The dog then jumped on my bf, admittedly in a friendly way. ""See? He just jumped on him. You're imposing.""

I was buzzed so we exchanged a few more words, but nothing particularly personal or nasty. There was no name calling on either side, no ""f you,"" but it was a tense exchange. 

Now that I'm sober and have had a few hours to reflect on the incident, I wanted to post a few additional thoughts:

* It's entirely possible that there were people in the bar who are terrified of dogs. Who were pissing their pants at the sight of a big Rottweiler. What about those people? Do you not even care about them?
* There's a *huge* difference between a dog like a Rottweiler vs a tiny designer dog like a Shih Tzu or Corgi or whatever is trendy now. Those small dogs are less threatening and appear more easily controlled than a huge Rottie. 
* What if there were other dogs in the bar? What if a dog fight broke out? What if the dog freaked out from the noise and the people and everything else? The owner said the dog was gentle, but *not everyone knows that.*

Overall, I found it to be amazingly presumptuous and self-centered to bring a massive dog like that to a busy bar, and just expect everyone to be ok with it. And then to confront someone who has issues with it - what nerve!",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,91696,public,confidence,self,Hey Seattle: it isn't acceptable to bring your 100 lb Rottweiler inside a busy bar,0,1561457083,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/c4i17c/hey_seattle_it_isnt_acceptable_to_bring_your_100/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Welcome back to our weekly meetup, 7:30 PM at Elysian Brewery, Pike &amp; 13th! We're in the back, downstairs.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Elysian doesn't close until midnight though so if you like to play late, some of us (like me) might be down.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! So long as you're twenty-one or older, we welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage or snack. Elysian is a public bar/restaurant, which has been very accommodating to our meetup needs, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ

Q: *Does this happen every week?*  

A: Yes, except for some major holidays, or when The Elysian is closed. I will make a cancellation post in either of those cases.

Q: *Do I have to bring games?*  

A: Nope! You're welcome to, but feel free to play the games that others and I have brought.

Q: *Is this always at The Elysian?*  

A: Yes. We've moved around a bit over the years, and Elysian was the best (only?) option for the latest move a few years ago. If you have a different venue in mind, let me know, and I will personally investigate. Keep in mind that we do have very particular needs^(1). Only Capitol Hill venues will be considered, there are other meetups for other areas.

Q: *Should I order at the bar?*  

A: Please don't, we have waiter service, and it's already confusing enough with how much we move around the tables.

Q: *Will I be welcome there?*  

A: Yes, in all likelihood. We take weirdos, normals, all kinds. Just don't be an asshole.

Q: *Can minors attend?*  

A: No, Elysian is 21+ only.

^(1) *We have variable attendance, 15-30. We move to different tables a lot. We need wide tables for game boards. We need separate checks. Some people are there for 3 hours and only order 1 iced tea.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I will be traveling to your neighborhood next August(2020), and I have so many questions. I am in the preliminary stages of developing a plan for this chapter. Neither of us have been to the NW before and are planning to rent a car and drive to Oregon, Washington, and BC over the course of 10 days.  Basically 3 days in each general location, sampling the finest cultures!!!! your States/Provinces have to offer. I’m seeking travel advice(my OCD satisfier is planning vacations)for the duration. Only decisions made are about the airline and the car rental. A bit about us, my wife and I are both 49 now, no kids to claim, spent a few years in Europe and Colorado, and both of us have lived in the Detroit area most of our lives.  Saying that we love Canadians and seek to make new memories in the NW. We travel mostly to chill and eat quality, well thought of, and satisfying food. 

Thanks all, this for our 50th Birthdays which are a few months apart next summer, El Cinco Cero!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I am seeking advice for things like:

&amp;#x200B;

Good Food neighborhoods in Seattle, not necessarily high end/hot spots, just quality food that reflects the neighborhoods spirit/pride. 

What cities do we stay in Oregon(Portland,Eugene…)?

Where would you take your buddies from out of town for an honest meal that tells me something about a Washington City? Vancouver? Oregon City of your choice? 

Where would be an authentic meal on say, a Wednesday night in your neighborhood?

What about Breakfast, we LOVE breakfast, most outstanding meal of the day???

Where’s an ideal neighborhood for us to AB&amp;B in, thinking away from the bands, and near the good Dutch Coffee shops(Think of where Therapists and Educators might live, like us)?

What are the quality neighborhood dispensaries you would recommend? 

Is there a Cannabis Cultural destination that is native to your location, like coffee, that is worth experiencing? 

What are the local things to do in August to get the vibe of Seattle? Portland? Vancouver?

The expressive part of these states, where people watching is at a premium?

Where would you go, in an afternoon drive, to be put in awe of nature and possibly lodge there one night?  Maybe a 3 hour radius, we like road trips, and love the UP of Michigan 

We don’t mind driving 3 or 4 hours a day if its a quality drive and is a worthy destination.

We plan on shopping for designer glass tubing as well, so any glass shops you could recommend?

We Like Beer and Spirits also.

I plan on cross-posting this to the other appropriate Subreddits as well, so there’s confusion.
