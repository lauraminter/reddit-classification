Welcome back to our weekly meetup. This week only, we'll be at Optimism Brewing, 1158 Broadway. I'll set out board games on one of the tables so you can find us.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

Many different sorts of people show up, though male programmers in their mid-20s are common. We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games^1, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ

Q: *Does this happen every week?*  
A: Yes, except for some major holidays, or when The Elysian is closed. I will make a cancellation post in either of those cases.

Q: *Do I have to bring games?*  
A: Nope! You're welcome to, but feel free to play the games that others and I have brought.

Q: *Is this always at The Elysian?*  
A: Yes. We've moved around a bit over the years, and Elysian was the best (only?) option for the latest move a few years ago. If you have a different venue in mind, let me know, and I will personally investigate. Keep in mind that we do have very particular needs^2. Only Capitol Hill venues will be considered, there are other meetups for other areas.

Q: *Will I be welcome there?*  
A: Yes, in all likelihood. We take weirdos, normals, all kinds. Just don't be an asshole.

^1 *I usually bring Concept, Smallworld, Seven Wonders, Splendor, VivaJave Dice Game, Race for the Galaxy, Codenames, Avalon, Biblios, Timeline, Hanabi, Fluxx, Citadels, Zombie Dice, Love Letter, playing cards and a box of dice.*

^2 *We have variable attendance, 15-30. We move to different tables a lot. We need wide tables for game boards. We need separate checks. Some people are there for 3 hours and only order 1 iced tea. We want semi-reasonably priced food and drinks.*

It's pretty much guaranteed to be cold and rainy and still dark, so it strikes me as a great thing to spend some time with others and play a few games.

Let me define my title a little bit.  To me, Medium strategy board games are games that play 4 to 6, take about an hour (to maybe an hour and a half) to play, and are a solid mix of luck and strategy.  This means if you are new, you won't feel overpowered even though you might lose, and if luck is with you every step of the way, you might even win.  It also means that if you are experienced, you might still lose.  I try to pick games where it takes maybe 5 minutes to explain the rules of the game, so they are not overly complicated.

These games are also normally ""thematically consistant"" which to me means that if it's a game about railroads, the rules fit the world of railroads.  If it's a game about panda bears eating bamboo, the rules give you points when the panda bear eats bamboo.  These thematic elements foster a certain amount of conversation.
 
I have plenty of room to set up 3 separate games going at once, so we ought to be able to accomodate as many folks as show up.  I have 5 games that I own, and will propose that we play.  Any game I have, I am more than willing to teach, and I'll give a few starting strategy hints as the game starts so that you can get a feel for it.  It's far more about having fun playing against an opponent thats playing well than having someone feel left behind.  There will probably be a number of people that have never played before so please do not feel intimidated if you want to explore the world of board games that you have no doubt been hearing about.  and, if you feel so inclined, I have created a facebook event for this that you may share with others: https://www.facebook.com/events/540801852979272/

If you want to bring a game, it should fit with this theme.


The Dragon House is in West Seattle at 5284 44th Ave SW.  It's the North East house on the corner of 44th and Brandon, and right there on the corner there is a 16 foot tall dragon that has been carved out of a tree that grew in that spot (hence the name).  Come up the concrete grand entry stairs on 44th just to the north of the dragon, and make your way past the trampoline, and head up the front steps to the house.  If you have any trouble finding the place, just call me at (207) 932-6622 and I can talk you in from anywhere.

Feel free to bring a beverage or a snack to share, but we will be keeping these OFF the tables and away from the games for the most part.

I'm going to list the games that I'd like to play.  Feel free to look them up online, they are all very popular in the gaming community, but more importantly they are all really fun to play.

Ticket to Ride.  This is a train based game where you build railroad segments in order to create routes (also called a tickets) that you draw at the start of the game.  At the end of the game any tickets you have built are points for you, any that you failed to build are points against you.  Be aware that there are a limited number of tracks between any two cities on the map, and if others build them first you may have to build a longer route to get to your destination.

Takenoko. (Jades favorite game!)  In this game, you are in the emporers garden.  You may add more gardens to the game board, you may help the bamboo grow, and you may have the panda eat bamboo, each of these activities can give you points.   There are also some random rolls for things that happen on your turn.  for example, if lightening strikes, the panda gets scared, and runs to some point on the board to eat bamboo (you know, stress eating to feel better about themselves).  Of course YOU get to determine where that is, and what color bamboo he eats, so, naturally scaring the panda can be a good thing.  (You brutes!)

Settlers of Cataan...  ok, not.  Lets play Star Trek Catan.  It's the same game with a twist.  In this game, you trade resources to build spacelanes and starbases.  On every players turn the dice is rolled, and that roll determines resources that every player might or might not get.  Then, you can see if the character you have has a power that will allow you to forcibly trade with someone, or make them discard some of their resources.  First person to build a proper network of space lanes and bases (ok, 10 points) wins.

The DC deck building game.   Set in the world of DC comics.   Everyone starts with an identical deck of 10 cards.  As you play, you buy cards of certain characters off the table to add to your deck, and as you cycle thru those characters they allow you to buy more and more powerful cards for your deck.    Along the way, if you have powerful enough hands you can ""defeat"" a supervillian and add that very powerful card to your deck.   You also start the game with a personna like the Flash, Batman, Superman or maybe Wonder Woman.  These characters make some cards more powerful for you.  (Oh, and Jake is NEVER allowed to be The Flash)

Carcassone.  This is a game of laying map tiles down on the board and as you do so claiming something about that tile.  The field?  The road?  The City?  The Cloister?  You claim that feature py putting one of your meeples on that feature, but you only have so many meeples, and they don't come back until that feature is complete (at which point you get the points), so use them wisely.  You can also end up sharing features with others, and so you each get all the points for it.  But if you try to share and they have more meeples?  Well, you get nothing!

I didn’t grow up in Ballard in the 60s, but some 25-odd years counts for something.

I moved into Fremont in 1990, when it was mostly silent and dark at night. Ditto for Ballard, which at night was virtually a ghost town.

But things change over a 25 yr span. I think Suzie Burke did a great job developing lower Fremont. It was going to happen, and it could have been a lot worse. 

520 and 90 have been hell since as far as I can remember. Oddly, it still takes about the same time to get from Ballard to UW as it did 20 years ago ...

BUT, what’s going to cause me to exit this beloved city is the sheer volume of people on the streets. Amazon campus during lunch resembles Safeco emptying after a game. And simply driving around Fremont or Wallingford reminds me of the video game Frogger. To be fair, these people are taking cars off the roads, but it’s not clear that it’s a zero sum game.

Again, things change. And this is their world. Ive just found it it interesting that pedestrians seem to be causing me more traffic problems than cars. Empirically, I’m probably wrong.
