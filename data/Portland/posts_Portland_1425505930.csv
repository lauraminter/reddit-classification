I hate to see people getting scammed; having been a part of some particularly ugly communities (EVE Online, Bitcoin, etc) I've seen it happen over and over and over. Really, it's depressing.

When just words words words and no proof leads to donations of money, you have a recipe for disaster. It doesn't even matter whether a specific instance is a scam, allowing this in general creates an environment where scammers will simply mimic the real ones until so many people get burned that it stops working - leading to a worse situation both for people who really need help and for those who want to help them. 

~~~So, I'm going to throw down the gauntlet. If this is allowed to continue unchecked, I may or may not make a post like the ones that are starting to crop up. You won't know it's me - it'll be another of my dozen accounts, probably one with a couple k karma to look legit. But I'd take the money and run.~~~

I'm posting on here because I don't know what else to do. I'm facing eviction from the apartment that I've lived in for 7 1/2 years. Everything was going great, until my then fiancé and I split up and he moved out in July. Well, unfortunately the following month my mother passed away after battling cancer and it sent me into a free fall. I had been working part time to try and help take care of her and living off of my measly 401k. When she died, I lost it and ended up taking some time off work. 

So long story short, I got a month behind on rent and have just not been able to catch up. In order for myself, my sweet puppy dogs and my kitty cat to stay in our home I have to come up with $1550 by Thursday morning. My primary goal is to avoid having the eviction on my record but I plan on moving into a friend's house next month. The landlord said I would have to be out by 3/15 if I don't pay the amount owed on Thursday.

I have a decent job and I work upwards of 60 hours a week. It seems like I've been hit with a financial crisis or a health crisis every other week. I don't have any family really, and my savings is behind depleted. I've looked into state and county funded programs, but as a single, childless female there aren't any real options for me. I'm asking for good old fashioned help. And in return I will do your taxes, walk your dog, wash your car, basically anything (well, not ANYTHING).

I know us redditors are not an independently wealthy lot, but I just don't know what else to do. I thought about setting up a go fund me site, but it seems like to get anything going you have to link it to your Facebook page? Well, pride is a bitch and ideally I wouldn't have to air my financial grievances to every one I went to high school with. So I do it here...I know, i know.

Thanks for reading. Wish me luck.

Everything is squared away. Thanks so much to everyone that offered their help and/or kind words.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,I'm am desperate and need help.

Me and another gentleman tried to catch her for close to an hour, to no avail. If I got too close she would get a bit aggressive (she was very, very, scared). She was wearing a black leash and red collar, so I assume (obviously) that she is someone's pet. She was constantly racing around, but she never ventured past the field/neighborhood, which made me think she was familiar with the area.   

I finally called animal control, but they were unable to catch her as well. The other gentleman returned in the evening, and with the help of some neighbors, was finally able to catch her.  

She was taken to Dove Lewis to be evaluated, and they will turn her over to animal services.

If you are interested or know someone who might be, read on!

We have worked with a couple cleaning companies and think a self employed person might fit our needs a little better. The person we are looking to hire will also be available to do other random jobs we might need done like organizing the garage, helping move furniture, packing/unpacking boxes, painting rooms, assembling Ikea furniture, etc. We want a go-getter! Someone who enjoys cleaning and organizing and wants to make money weekly as well as doing odd jobs! A cleaning handy person! A Jack or Jane of all trades!

Ideally, they will come on Thursdays because that day only one dog and the cat will be home, but if the right person was busy Thursdays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays two dogs and the cat will be home so that would work too.

We have had most of the house cleaned a couple times recently, so we just need someone to keep it up and take care of what they didn't do, like windows, tops of door frames, cobwebs on walls, under the bed, etc.  Our house is 2-story and has a master bed/bath, an office, a living room, dining room, guest bed/bath and kitchen that will all need weekly maintenance along with sheets changed. There is also a craft/pet room that will need the floors cleaned and the litter box changed weekly.  

We can supply the cleaning materials, including a vacuum and Shark steam mop or you can bring your own.

We are located in SE Portland and would like someone to start next week.

If you've ever been interested in joining a team sport or playing futsal this would be a great chance to do it! Lots of fun and a great workout.

Here are the details:

* Games will be on Sundays starting March 15th. We don't know if it's afternoon or night games.
* Rose City Futsal is a great location. Well lit and it comes with a bar.
* 8 games over 8 weeks.
* It'll cost somewhere around $50-$60 for the entire session. Exact amount is based on how many players we have (8-9).

D5 is the lowest level so even if you're new to the sport, you won't be entirely outclassed. We're also pretty supportive. We like to win, but we also like to have fun so if you screw up (which I have multiple times) nobody is going to beat up on you.

There are no tryouts, but if you're a keeper (or a part time keeper) you get preference! Otherwise we're looking for 2-3 guys.

PM or comment here if you're interested or have more questions.

(Might also have a spot opening up for my Thursday evening D5 team)
