&amp;#x200B;

This isn't an urgent post, just one borne of curiosity. I lived on Sauvie Island in the mid-1990s, and every day I rode in to Portland, I would see an old man selling hand-woven ivy baskets on the side of the road, near one of the roads going up the hill from St. Helens Road, maybe right by/under the St. John's Bridge. 

My mother stopped once and bought a woven ivy Christmas tree angel from him, and discovered that he was blind and had been coming down that road to make and sell ivy baskets and decorations for most of his life. She recalls seeing at least one article in the Oregonian about him over the years, and a tribute to him after he died. 

Again, this is just for the sake of my curiosity, but does anyone else have memories of this guy, or know where I can find an article online that actually mentions him?",True,False,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,131069,public,self,Question about the identity of a blind ivy basket weaver in the 1990s,0,1562989665,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/cc5r4i/question_about_the_identity_of_a_blind_ivy_basket/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bikers Ultimate guide to riding in Portland and achieving Moral Superiority while Still Being Awesome!

Biking in Portland is a challenge…

* Laws are confusing and poorly understood.
* There are many different types of riders with varying opinions of what is right and wrong.
* Are we riders? Cars? Pedestrians? How do we communicate that to others on the road?
* Lots of people want to tell you what their rights are, but not many people talk about their responsibilities. We need to be better aware of both.

The following are the rules of the road that I believe work best for all involved and are the result of commuting to work almost every day, year round, for 3 years. I am also a driver.

Here are the things I work on:

* Be Excellent to Each Other!
* If there is a bike between your legs, you are a bike, and need to follow the rules of the road just like a car. If you want the rights of a pedestrian, dismount and walk. Ignore those horrible signs by someone at the city that encourage bikes to be treated like pedestrians…sometimes. Be consistent. If you are on a bike boulevard and crossing a busy street, wait like a car, or dismount like a pedestrian. If there is a bike between your legs, you are a bike, and therefore need to follow the rules of the road like a car.
* Get a bell. Pee Wee Herman the shit out of it. Remember, bells are awesome! It says “hey baby! Nice work on that hill! Keep it up!” and “Dude! You rocked that flat! Love you tons”. The bell is the rainbow from the unicorn’s butt! It says, “I respect you and care about you and want you to be safe!” and “BTW…passing yo ass!”. Plus, pedestrians tend to leap at inopportune moments, so good to bell them up as well.
* Ride straight lines – Swerving in and out of your lane makes it difficult to pass. Be consistent so others can anticipate
* No line, no lane – I know the law says you can pass cars on the right, but don’t. Odds are, there is a better route. Find it.
* Stay off of arterial collectives – yes, the law says you can do it, but don’t. Burnside? Cornell? Taylors Ferry? Sandy? Scholls Ferry? Hawthorne? 33rd? Srsly!?! Why would ANYONE want to ride a bike on these? I have been rec riding with the spandex clad. Really don’t understand this as a sport. Yes, you have rights, but by the time your rights are aggravating everyone and endangering you, I think you need to rethink your definition of fun. Lead, follow, or get out of the way, but don’t keep people from getting to their jobs or home to their families.
* Yield right of way – Here we go…I roll stop signs and red lights ALL. THE. TIME. I justify this by saying that the traffic signs/lights are there to regulate traffic, and if there is no traffic, there is nothing to regulate. This REALLY pisses people off. I yield right of way religiously. I stop for pedestrians when they have the right of way, and insist they go before I will. I stop for cars parking through the bike lane when I could swerve around. I queue with cars at stops so I don’t create confusion at the intersection or block a driver turning right. But I CAN NOT sit at a red light with no traffic coming. I wish they would change stops to yields for bikes, but until then, I will continue to be an asshole.
* Lights, reflective gear, helmet – Remember, it does not matter as they never see you anyway, and the ones who do are trying to kill you, but when they do scrape your body off the road and your lights are shining bright…they won’t be able to say you are part of the problem.
* Don’t argue with cars at intersections – They are scared of us and don’t know how to treat us. Are we bikes? Cars? Pedestrians? Hell, we can’t decide, it’s no wonder nobody else knows. Yield right of way and insist others do the same. When you come to a 4way stop, don’t let the guy with the right of way wave you through. Whether they are being a nicehole or don’t know the rules of the road. The next car is watching the car that has rights. If they don’t see you and you go, you are in the kill zone. It gets ugly. I have been having great luck with the “down look”. I ignore traffic until they go. Track stand and look down. Once they realize you can’t see their “go ahead” wave, they go pretty fast.
* Understand and resist the sin of “mental inertia”. Cars do this ALL THE TIME. The car in front goes to parallel park. EVERYONE KNOWS the front end will swing out…but we are moving, we see a hole, and we can get around. I have observed that this is 10x worse on a bike. Remember, no line, no lane. Yield right of way. And of course, be excellent to each other.
* Don’t attempt to educate other riders – there are tons of different styles of riding and different types of riders. Nothing is gained by attempting to advise other riders they are doing it wrong. Save the rant for Reddit.
* Sidewalks – Legally allowed, but just about impossible to do with anyone around without being an asshole. Dismount if anybody around.
* Parked cars – Ride outside the door swing. If you are uncomfortable taking up that much road, find a better route. These are, IMO, the most common serious injuries out there. Doors are sharp and they don’t yield at all.

I apparently violated a rule of this sub - the rules against ""creepshots"" - by going to an area that someone had posted on craigslist (65th and Powell) and taking some photos and posting them here.

I'm very saddened by this.  I thought I was doing a good deed.  

I had a bike stolen three days ago.  I thought I might find it at a place like the one at 65th and Powell.  When it wasn't there, I thought, ""well, these bikes might belong to others, I might as well get some photos.""  So I did.  

A man started yelling at me; I took his photo too.

I just want to have a discussion about this: is this really the kind of content we want to push out of this sub?  I know that if my bike were one of those depicted, I'd love to know its location.

There was nothing even vaguely ""creepy"" about any of these photos - they were taken in full public view on a public sidewalk.

I ask that this rule be amended to clarify that pictures taken in public are permissible.  Looking at the front page of this sub, there are plenty of links to newspaper and other articles which have photos of public spaces with recognizable faces.

[About the band: ](http://www.theriversidefolk.com/)

The Riverside is a band of friends from California and Texas, founded by husband and wife duo, Jacob and Lorien Jeanson. Circled around one microphone, the band relies on one another to find balance in their music. This traditional type of performance is one that seems to be drowned out in a world of loud music. With vocal harmony and their folk-rooted stringed instruments, the band paints landscapes and tells their stories.

Through traveling the country together and speaking honestly about many highs and lows, The Riverside strives to be a family that grows together, and a band that helps listeners carry on down this life's winding river.

Even if you can not make it please check out this amazing group of talented musicians.  [https://youtu.be/73d8sHHViq0](https://youtu.be/73d8sHHViq0)
