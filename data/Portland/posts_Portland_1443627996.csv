I decided to pretend I was given a 30 day no cause termination and set my ceiling at $1,000. 

The first thing I did was scope roommates. [Well this fake ad was depressing](http://i.imgur.com/iRF2kYP.png). Well okay let's go [live in the suburbs with a roommate](http://i.imgur.com/7YRgcA9.png) and also don't own anything because it won't fit in your $775 room plus friends/socializing in your rented room is off limits. [Here's one that was reasonable and closer in except when I read the fine print](http://i.imgur.com/UuVD5qV.png). Here's one a few blocks from where I live that was $750+ for a room [with the bonus that he sorta expects you to walk his dog for him](http://imgur.com/Nc8Exjr). Well shit, it would be pretty ""entitled"" of you to pay money for a room and expect the landlord to take care of his own animal. [Here's an example of very illegal room postings I saw all over the place](http://i.imgur.com/YrBJHQK.png). If you're male don't expect to be considered. I saw rooms requesting you be an introvert, queer, vegan, drug free (even legal weed) and someone who never had friends over. Also quiet hours are 9pm. [Here's a room in Cully that includes a farm and hints at the fact you're going to live in a cluttered hippie home](http://i.imgur.com/lbjiGk9.png). Oh [this is like an apartment for $500](http://i.imgur.com/GN8TzyI.png) way the hell out and also implies a certain age bracket suggesting it's ""perfect for retired people"". Stuff like seeking female, seeking vegans, NO COUPLES, male Christians only abound. All discrimination. [Here's a perfect example where they list the ideal AGE RANGE](http://i.imgur.com/OP1JTN2.png) which also I believe had a gender discrimination. [In order to live here you have to fit into being an introverted Christian](http://i.imgur.com/sMwJLKg.png). The award for the most depressing room share? [You can pay $700 a month to live in the most awkward situation in town](http://i.imgur.com/GuZloDJ.png). As someone who pays a little more than $700 for a 1 bedroom very close to this room share let me say you're paying the lion's share of this rental to have 'a stranger' in your living room. While I did this in my 20s in Ohio I also paid $150 a month for a $325 a month apartment. In fact, one of the most reasonable rentals I found after looking at 90% of the listings [was listed by the poster child for 22 year old cliche hipsters living close in](http://i.imgur.com/OIEh7bN.png). 

A while back someone pulled [this listing](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5242854368.html) as within minutes finding affordable renting in Portland. It's amazing because [there's about 6 affordable rentals in a so-so part of Portland](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5232158312.html). How about we take a closer look [at the rental you get when you need an apartment for yourself and your baby/child/pet](http://koin.com/2014/04/14/tenants-say-management-ignored-concerns/). Each and every affordable listing I searched pulled up the same kind of reviews. [I have been inside this dump in one of their studios in 2013](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5232620519.html) under unfortunate conditions. (Not a renter) At the time it was a hair under $600. [Most recent review for this company with several rentals in town is terrible and 6 months old](https://www.facebook.com/CnRWatergate/reviews?ref=page_internal). Supposedly crazy affordable MONTAVILLA? [This is more than my current close in hipster barista rental](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5206095203.html). Not a one-off because it was the ONLY 'affordable' under $1000 rental listed!!! [Here's another. $700 a month gets you a hot plate and the world's most pathetic sink in the burbs](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5236394290.html). [World's smallest 1 bedroom for $685 in Gresham](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5241838645.html) and [another for $750 in Gresham](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5235909625.html). [And here's a room in St Johns that's just as expensive as rooms in inner SE](http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/apa/5241617820.html). 

TL;DR: I actually researched 90% of the listed under $1000 rentals and ALL those with multiple listings for below market were basically death traps that were owned by slumlords. Since my last apartment hunt in 2012 the rental situation has grown worse, rents in 2012-era 'affordable' (under $800/mo) sketchy places are almost at the $900 mark in many cases and a huge amount of room shares seem like illegal sublet type situations or flagrantly discriminatory. And edit to say apparently the room share situation is legal but it makes finding affordable housing in the 30 to 60 day mark really hard if your budget is anything $1000 or less.

So my route driving to work takes me through the intersection at SE 20th and Ankeny every day.

Take special note of the yellow bicycle signs on either side. It's an incredibly popular bike route to downtown, as I'm sure most of you know.

This morning heading northbound a man on a bike approached on the right heading westbound on Ankeny. He had his feet down, coming to a stop as I passed. He yelled at me, flipped me off as he pulled further into the intersection, coming dangerously close to running into me.

On the way home, there were a lot of bikes waiting to cross, including a couple who were inching their way into the intersection, so I stopped to let them go through since there was no oncoming traffic. The car behind me threw a fit, honking and shouting and giving me the ""what the fuck is wrong with you"" hand gesture.

**Every. single. day.** at this intersection there is some sort of near-death experience or road-rage incident with someone. Today was the double-whammy and I'm finally done guessing what the fuck is supposed to happen here. I know that the yellow signs don't mean stop, they're a warning that bicycles cross through there, but considering bicyclists love to test the limits of safety here, when I get a vibe, I tend to stop to let them through.

...I happened upon a small smouldering bark dust fire.  It was about 2'x2'... not very fierce, nor frightening, still... could grow.

I proceeded to dump the entire contents of my water bottle around the area that was smoking the most... no impact.  It appeared to be growing, and was burning slowly underground.  I'm thinking... ""stomp it out!... but what if it's electrical?"" ""smother it... with what?... more bark dust?""... 

Anyway, by this point 2 people talking to themselves, 3 cyclists, and 1 seemingly normal neighborhood passerby all noted the smoke... and carried on.  

One... I repeat, one... super rad neighborhood guy finally shows up and asks what's up.  He questions me about neighbors (already checked, none home)... and a hose in their yard, to which I say ""I'm not trespassing""... I mean not unless this thing gets bigger anyway.  He nods and scurries off toward what I presume is his home a few blocks away.

By this point, feeling perhaps a little silly, I call 911.  The nice lady at dispatch understood what kind of fire it was... and sent the fire brigade anyway.  They arrived about 5 mins later and grinned at the fire... and began deciding if they needed to pull a hose out or just open the trucks side gasket and blast it.  ...then, our neighborhood hero (the one who asked about grabbing that neighbors hose) reappears with a watering can.  Too late... but all the same... humbling.  What a guy.  If the truck had never come, he would have saved the day.

I know this has little to do with this experience, but I am high functioning (autistic)... I admit I am hyper-vigilant.  I also never pass a smoking fire and assume someone else will handle it.  

Shame on all you people who did.

Cheers to the water can hero, and our city's punctual fire men &amp; women.

We were cussed at, yelled at, had her keys thrown at us and were kicked off the property for arguing the quality of the repairs done on her car. Over 2 visits in an attempt to have an extremely bad wheel bearing fixed and window mechanics diagnosed for a window that wouldn't roll up, she was charged $50 for the diagnostic. But after the diagnostic they had broken the door handle inside the vehicle so the door could not be opened. They claimed they had nothing to do with this. Had it checked by another mechanic who said it was clearly broken by Halsey and not completely put back together. The other mechanic only charged $7 for the diagnostic and repair. Halsey ripped her off to repair nothing and break the door.

As for the wheel bearing that was bad, it never got fixed during that visit! They replaced the wrong one! One that was in good shape. She was told to bring the car back and they would fix it. They fixed the bearing and charged over $550 for $225 in actual repairs as she was charged for wrongful work that was their fault.

When complaining about the quality of service they got extremely aggressive and hostile. We were repeatedly yelled at by the mechanic to shut up and told we were liars. Their excuse was things magically broke like a light bulb not turning on one day (no joke), which is ridiculous because a door handle doesn't magically break after the door has been taken apart and a bearing doesn't magically go bad between being repaired by the mechanic and picked up by the owner. 

They're very kind until you have anything negative to say about their quality of work done to your vehicle. After looking at the recommended and not recommended reviews on Yelp we see we're not the only ones with this experience. (Quick sum up of Yelp. We signed up specifically to write that review which automatically lists us in the not recommended reviews because it's how Yelp ""prevents"" spam posts until you upload a profile picture and or other reviews. There were 15+ one star reviews in the not recommended section of which people had the same issues and clearly signed up just to write a review like us.)

Below you can find screenshots of the review and their threatening reply from the employee of Halsey Automotive.

To sum it up, we were treated like horrible people, yelled at, cursed at, thrown keys at and 86'd from the property for arguing the quality of their horrendous service.

Update (9/30): Halsey Automotive is threatening us with legal action for the reviews posted to Yelp and Facebook. They have also privately messaged us talking about ""possibly"" pursuing legal action. 
In the screenshot below, they claim they they ""set"" the keys down on the counter when in reality they threw them at us. While the keys didn't hit us they were nonetheless thrown at us. We never attacked them physically or verbally only calmly argued about the problems with their service. However the employee did attack us verbally and did attempt to start physical confrontation with me.

One of my best friends went through Hooper Detox and, after finishing detox, was immediately placed in a free sober living facility referred to as the ""8 by 8"" (slang, not actual name). At the 8x8 he went through a fairly standard intensive outpatient program, coupled with free Vivitrol shots. The 8x8 sounds like an old converted SRO, similar to where u/tracy415 stayed when she first got clean. I'm curious if his path from Hooper straight in to housing is the norm with CCC or if he just got lucky... I've heard some people get referred to a more intense program that's entirely inpatient.
