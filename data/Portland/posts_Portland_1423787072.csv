For the unfamiliar - With the advent of cheaper genetic testing, many people are finding a mutation in their MTHFR gene.  This codes for an enzyme that converts vitamin B9, folic acid, into a usable form.  Because this process is impaired in individuals with this mutation, your body can get really out of whack, interfering with your body's ability to detox, causing excess inflammation and imbalances the rest of your body with things like hormones and neurotransmitters and other vitamins and minerals.  It's linked to a lot of mental and physical problems such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, digestive issues, immune disorders and many more.  This is probably the best synopsis I've found:  http://www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/mthfr/

*   Portland, Oregon, is the 23rd largest city in the United States, but the Portland metro area represents the 9th largest Native American community in the United States.
*    38,000 Native American people live in Multnomah County. The 2000 U.S. census cites approximately 31,000 Native people living in the city of Portland.
*    Out of every 100 Native students who begin as freshmen in high school, only 34 will graduate from Portland public high schools in their senior year. Of those 34, a mere 17 will receive a standard diploma.
*    In Multnomah County, according to the 2000 census, 25 percent of the Native population earns less than $10,000 per year, and 25 percent earns less than $24,000 per year. This means that fully half of the Native population lives in deep poverty.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,default,"Portland is home to the ninth largest Native American population in the United States.
