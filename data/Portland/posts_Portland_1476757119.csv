The last few years there were never really any problems, but the idea of being able to get gigabit internet from CenturyLink was certainly alluring. Then AT&amp;T started offering a deal where you get unlimited data if you also have DirecTV, and since I know that CenturyLink offers DirecTV bundles, and our Comcast contract just ended, I figured it was time to jump ship.

However what ensued was the worst customer service nightmare I have ever experienced, bar none. I have to say that CenturyLink and DirecTV are basically running a bait-and-switch scam on multiple levels, and they both have completely worthless customer care departments where the poor agents are utterly powerless to do anything to correct a bad situation. After probably 30 hours of phone calls to about 10 different people I finally threw in the towel and am cancelling both services. 

Here's the story of what happened, below, so that hopefully, none of you fall victim to the same scam.

From what I can tell the main problem starts with CenturyLink's sales people. They have a PRISM TV call center in Idaho Falls and then they have another one at their main 1-800 number. The sales people will basically tell you whatever they imagine that you want to hear. I told the lady I had seen $99/month for DirecTV Premiere Package All-Included for 2 years, and asked what a bundle deal with the gigabit would cost. I was quoted $209.99/mo. less a $15/mo. discount (before taxes), with the gigabit comprising $109.99 and the DirecTV comprising $99.99 of that (with up to two additional DVRs included).

I said it sounded good and booked an install date.

First thing that happened was that DirecTV did not show up at the original install date. They came a few days later. The day before the install guy came, I noticed that the e-mail DirecTV had sent us showed our monthly charges as $99/mo. plus $15 for an equipment charge, $7 for the first TV, and $7 for the second TV&gt; That's $127.99/mo., not $99.99. So I called DirecTV and spoke with customer care. I said we were quoted $99.99; they said just to tell the installer to only do one TV, and then that would be our price. So that's what I did.

At the install, the installer, once he had permanently attached the dish to my house with a series of bolts, and only installed one TV like I asked, he demanded that I sign on his phone's screen something stating that I agreed to whatever terms they had sent me via e-mail. I stated that I had qualms about that because we still had not received anything via e-mail that clearly stated the terms we were quoted. I asked him to confirm that the billing would be $99.99 for two years, like we were quoted by the CenturyLink salesperson. He said I would have to call customer care and that they would make sure we got whatever deal we were quoted by CenturyLink.

So I promptly called customer care. I was told that it had to be escalated and I'd get a call back within 10 days. About a week later a lady called back and told me that the deal was $121.99/mo. for 12 months, and that then, it would go back up to $165.99/mo. for the remaining 12 months. I explained the whole story to her, and she said that she would request a copy of the original sales call, and that if it validated my claim about the price I was quoted, then they would match that price. Additionally, she said that if I cancelled now, then I would incur a substantial early termination fee because they only allow a 24-hour period after installation during which you can cancel without penatly! Wow! (That was never stated anywhere in the agreements we were sent originally, and furthermore, I was told by them to wait 10 days when I called with my complaint at the outset, within the initial 24 hours.) Further, she said, it would take up to 10 additional business days for me to hear back.

However, being a trusting person who normally gives the benefit of the doubt, I told her, ""OK, I will wait"" -- even though everything in my being said to just cancel it now. 

So, she calls me back exactly 1 week later, on Sunday morning at 9AM sharp, while I was still asleep. I was given a number to call back with a PIN to use. I was busy Sunday, but called back the following Tuesday and got a different person. 

I had to re-explain the whole saga to this next guy, only to have him tell me that they did receive the call log, and it showed that the price I was quoted was for the ""Extra"" package. I told him that their call transcript was incorrect (undoubtedly from a different call) because I had been 100% crystal clear multiple times on the sales call that I wanted the *Premiere* package, since it's the only one that has Longhorn Network (that carries exclusive games from my alma mater... cheesy, I know). I had the salesperson confirm it to me several times that she was setting us up with the Premiere package -- and that's exactly what I got, the Premiere package. 

However, now, DirecTV support was telling me that they had a transcript of that sales call and that I was quoted the Extra package -- which was blatantly false. Furthermore, the guy told me that their records showed I had ordered my services from a retailer called ""ClearLink,"" and he acted like I was lying to him when I said it had been ordered through CenturyLink!! I googled ""ClearLink"", and evidently they are the company who owns Sprint. I speculated that perhaps they owned the subcontractor that runs CenturyLink's call center where sales are conducted -- but how the fuck am I supposed to know? 

The DirecTV guy started to get testy as I insisted that the information in his system was incorrect and inaccurate (which it was). Finally he told me he needed to have the other lady call me back the following day, since she was off currently. I was like, ""OK, but please have her call after noon.""

So of course, she (the second lady I had talked to at DirecTV support, the one who had called me back at Sunday 9AM) called me back the next day at 9AM (not after noon as I had requested). I explained to her how my conversation with her colleague had gone the previous day: how the call transcript in their system was not from my call, and how he had told me that I had called ClearLink and not CenturyLink -- which was also wrong. I had her go to CenturyLink's website and I showed her the actual phone number that I had used to contact CenturyLink. 

Then I told her that she could either set up our account with the services for $99/month for two years of the Premiere All-Included package like we had been quoted by the CenturyLink salesperson, or else I would cancel my account. I said that if she wanted to get an actual audio file of the phone call that I had originally, and it showed something different than what I was claiming, then I would gladly pay whatever price they dictated to me, because I was 100% confident any actual legitimate recording of the original call would validate my claims — not that I as a customer should have to prove such a thing in the first place. 

She assured me that she would go back and review the call again, and assured me that she would make the changes to our account that I had requested (to make it in alignment with what CenturyLink had originally quoted). She said she would call me back later that day. She never called me back, not that day (Friday), and not on Saturday, or Sunday, or Monday.

Instead, I had to call back on Monday afternoon. I got a nice gentleman and explained the whole saga to him. He was very apologetic. I told him he could either honor the deal, and make sure we got an e-mail confirming it in writing, or else cancel our account. He counter-offered me $101.99 for one year, and then $165.99 after that, and I said, ""No."" 

I told him to cancel the account. He said he was going to cancel it and waive the early termination fee (which I have read online can be up to $450). I recorded him (with his permission and consent) stating that our account would be closed, we would pay for the month of service that we used, and we would have no early termination fees. I asked him to send us an e-mail stating that in writing. He sent us three separate e-mails, all of which said the same thing: 

    To avoid an Early Cancellation Fee, you must reactivate the equipment that was deactivated, reinstate your DIRECTV account and remain a DIRECTV customer for the remainder of the agreement.

!!!!!!! For reals !!!!!! We literally read this to him over the phone and said, ""Hey, you *just told us that you would waive the early termination fee* and then when we asked you to confirm that to us in writing, *you sent us an e-mail stating the exact opposite!* He then goes silent for awhile and muttered stuff about, ""Let me figure this out,"" and, ""Hold on for a minute,"" and muttered something about a Microsoft Word document, etc. I could not make sense out of it. Finally he told us it had been sent to our account but that since our account was cancelled we could not log in and view it. However I was able to login to the account; and after that there was no way to view any account-related messages. 

And that's just the DirecTV half of the story!!

Now let me tell you about the 20 hours I spent on the phone with CenturyLink trying to get *them* to give us the price that *they* quoted us... how they created an additional install appointment and sent someone to my house randomly without asking me... how they informed us that we would not be able to link our AT&amp;T account with our DirecTV account and still receive the discount that we were quoted, despite the fact that the salesperson had assured me that ""tons"" of her customers had done *exactly that*... how a door-to-door salesperson came by minutes after I got off the sales call, and offered us a price that was less than half of what the lady on the phone had offered, and was printed on a flyer that I found in our mailbox, yet nobody at CenturyLink would acknowledge the existence of that deal nor would they honor it... I could tell you about all that, about the times I was transferred around to people who then did not know anything about the context of the call and were not in the department I was supposed to be transferred to after waiting 30 minutes on hold... about the rudeness of the customer service people and their total inability to do anything at all to resolve my concerns... about how I e-mailed them a detailed summary of all these issues and despite my threatening to report them to the FTC, Oregon Secretary of State, and BBB, they did not even bother to respond after an entire week... and so many other things that have blurred together... like how they promised we'd receive a single bill for our CenturyLink and DirecTV services but then we didn't...

... but I won't, because I'm frankly done with these two companies forever, and I suggest that you never, ever do business with either CenturyLink or AT&amp;T if you can at all possibly avoid it. 

Instead I'll tell you about how terrible DirecTV's mobile app and DVR are. Their DVR has a search feature that finds literally everything except the channel and show that you want to watch. For example if the Portland TrailBlazers are playing and you search for that, you'll get all 28 current and upcoming NBA games over the next week, and the one you want will be 27th on the list. Or if you search for Sports &gt; Football you'll get every vaguely football-related movie or TV show airing for the next month, and the actual sporting event *that is currently airing live* will be nine pages down if you actually manage to scroll that far before shooting yourself in the face with a sawed-off shotgun. Then, you might think, just use the DirecTV mobile app instead if the DVR app sucks. Nope nope nope. 

The DirecTV app is even worse! If you browse channels you cannot filter them by content or name. If you do a search, it searches everything. For example on Sunday I just wanted to watch some NFL games, so I searched NFL. The results I get are ""NFL Matchup,"" ""NFL 360,"" ""NFL Insiders,"" ""NFL Live,"" ""NFL Postgame,"" ""NFL PrimeTime,"" ""The NFL Today,"" etc. etc. etc. ... literally over 50 different things, **none of which were the actual games that were currently airing.** Only once I got to the 73rd thing on the list (yes I counted!) did I see ""Giants @ Los Angeles"", which I clicked on. Then I am presented with a screen that says, ""New York Jets @ Arizona Cardinals"" four times, then ""Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers"" four times, and so on, for all the games airing over the next week, in a window titled, ""Bills @ Dolphins."" Who fucking designed this shit?! It's the worst app I've ever used for anything on any device!! 

Say what you will about Comcast, but at least their fucking app and DVR software are *functional* and easy to use. The X-one DVR may have a bit of lag to its user interface, but at least IT ACTUALLY FINDS WHAT YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR. Comcast may have high prices but at least when you sign on to a 2-year deal, it actually lasts for two years, and they don't lie to you about what the price is going to be. At least when you call them and you wait on hold for 30 minutes, the person you get is able to resolve your issue without having to make 9 additional phone calls and then cancel your account because nobody could do jack shit to keep a customer (like at DirecTV).

I mean I literally told DirecTV, ""I am willing to agree to paying you $99/mo. for two full years for this TV package; that's $2400 your company gets of my money, and all you have to do is simply honor the price I was originally quoted. If you can't do that, then I'm cancelling my account."" And after all the phone calls they were just like, ""Nope, sorry, can't do it."" And I cancelled my account. 

TLDR: DirecTV's app, DVR, and customer service are terrible and makes Comcast seem like a God (which I could not have believed would be possible). CenturyLink is running a fucking scam where their sales people lie to you about what things will cost and what the terms of the agreements will be and then when you try to call in and get the deal you were offered, nobody will honor the deal and you get the run around and are forced to either cancel your service or eat shit. 

**** UPDATE ****

The day after posting this, a Century Link executive escalations guy calls me. He basically said they would honor the price I was quoted but they couldn't do anything about the DirecTV account, which I had just cancelled the previous night after they wouldn't do jack. So I said, ""Alright that's fine,"" and told him I'd accept them giving me that deal. I was going to update this post here and at least give them a good review for having finally gotten back to me and resolved my concerns. 

However, tonight, my CenturyLink internet service is completely shut off. I run the service troubleshooter and it says, ""Account deactive."" I called in and the tech support person said I was ""lucky"" because they could send a technician out on Saturday morning (today is Thursday). Woot! Cough.

So I login to their website, and it says my bill is over $300 despite having only had the service for less than a month. When I click to see a bill summary, it says none is available. Wow. I call the tech support line again (because of course, their customer service number is only available during my work hours M-F, meaning that I have to take time off of work anytime I want to call them, which has so far always taken at least an hour due to all the transfers and such).

I need your help confronting our landlord about the condition the historic house we rent in inner SE. Not sure if this tidbit is relevant but it is on the National Register of Historic Places. I live here with 4 roommates (myself [23F] three other women in their mid 20's and one man, early 30's). We rent the home from the landlord who we will call Greg. Right now we split the rent evenly at $3,000/month. He told me when I moved in last October that he has owned the home for many years and used to live here himself. He now lives in NE somewhere.   

The house itself really is beautiful and has lots of amazing historical features that I truly appreciate. But what I don't appreciate is the condition of the home itself and Greg's neglectfulness. I'll elaborate...

The yard is completely neglected. Moss and weeds have taken over the porches and yards. It beginning to look like a hunted house (appropriate for this time of year). Greg doesn't do yard maintenance and began offering the tenants $50 a month to maintain the yard. I tried this for a couple of months but without proper tools or man power it was overwhelming to attempt on my own. There is just so much accumulated debris that any work I completed didn't show. I think he tried to hire a young man to do yard maintenance once. The man showed up at our door and was asking for Greg and said he was there to mow the lawn and Greg never showed up. There is nothing about tenants being responsible for yard maintenance in the lease. What it does say is ""resident agrees to keep all areas of the premises clean, sanitary, and free from any accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, and garbage..."" 

As far as what we do regularly to try and maintain the house:
We try to keep the yard clear of trash and things that other people dump there. We live near a busy intersection with lots of bars so people will dump beer cans, cigarette butts, boxes of ""free stuff"", misc. garbage, dog poop baggies, shopping bags, etc.
We sweep up the porches of leaves, and keep the inside clean. We are a neat bunch which I (and Greg probably) appreciate. 

He mentioned to me this summer that he going to come by within the next few weeks with a friend to prune the fruit trees, haul away the piles of debris and branches, clear the yard out, etc. He cut the branches of one small tree in the side yard that was taking over a grill that hasn't been used in years. And hasn't completed anything else he mentioned. 

He told me while I was doing the yard work in the past he has received letters from disappointed neighbors saying things like ""We have admired your house for years but it seems like the condition has gone by the wayside."" At first I felt sympathy for him that they would go out of their way to dis his house, but now I understand why. 

He has come by the house maybe two other times in the year that I've lived here and the only thing he checked in on was to make sure all the soft wood floors were covered with rugs.

There is a tub in the upstairs bathroom that apparently leaks into the kitchen if it is used. I never attempted to use it for this reason obviously. Recently the tub started filling up with smelly, very dirty looking water from the drain of the shower adjacent to it while in use. It took three weeks of texting Greg asking him what to do about it, until he sent a friend over one afternoon without telling us to fix it. It's ""fixed"" now and doesn't fill up with water but still can't be used.

A few last random things that Greg has done (or not done):
When the oven display was broken and would only heat to 350 or 375 he told us to look for the manual and fix it. I looked and there is no manual, and we aren't going to pay to fix it. It even says in our lease ""Resident shall not tamper with the heating system, *appliances*...""

It says in the lease to ""contact owner before starting the first fire of the year"" in the fireplace. Yesterday I asked him via text ""I wanted to ask you if we needed to check up on the fireplace at all before using it this winter. I know how to check and see if the flue is open. Do you think it needs an inspection?"" His reply to me was verbatim ""Yes, if you want to use you should get a chimney sweep to clean and inspect it."" There is nothing in the lease about either party paying for an inspection, is this our responsibility?
He also texted our male roommate after this saying something like ""tell everyone to check their smoke detectors.""

So reddit, what advice to do you have for us?
I know a lot of this sounds like regular landlord shiftiness, which most everyone has dealt with. 
I would like to confront him about the issues that I pointed out here. What is the best way to go about this? What can I say to him about the smaller fixes to the house and who is responsible for paying for these services? What are we responsible for as tenants even if some things I mentioned aren't anywhere in the lease?

It's his house, and if this is the way he feels he should maintain it, I am okay with that. It's livable and I am not complaining about how much I pay for rent.

One last thing: I know ""just move out if you don't like it"" is a solution. 

Thank you in advance for your suggestions!

edit: I would like to mention that ""debris"" was unclear to us. At the signing of the lease Greg never mentioned anything to us about 1.) maintaining the yard or 2.) pets. Which I feel are two of the most important things when renting out your house. I had to dig through the lease to find a statement under the section ""Care of Premises"" that talks about interior of the house (fire hazards, leaky faucets, etc). However he did go out of his way to tell me to only clean the floors with a solution of vinegar and water and pointed out where in the lease this was stated. As well as to NEVER use the tub upstairs. 

**tldr** Our landlord hasn't been up-keeping our home and it is starting to look like a haunted house. He asks us to pay for fixes out of pocket and isn't attentive when things are broken.

I realize that pure silicon crystals are quite valuable, and I don't want to spend much. But I'd be totally fine with one of the irregular tops of the crystals, or a piece that was contaminated and is not useful for chip manufacture. Also, I'm curious to hear if anyone thinks it would not be a good idea to have something like this around the house? Are they extremely sharp, or prone to shattering or anything?

Since there's so much chip manufacture happening around Portland, and many folks here who seem to be involved in the industry, I thought it would be worth asking if somebody knows where I could find something like this.

This is affecting my family's business and our only source of income because customers don't want to come and have no spots to park in. How can I ask the city or anyone to put up a 2 hour or so parking limit post sign on the sidewalk to limit how long a vehicle can stay in one spot?

Thank you in advance for any exceptional advice.",False,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,How to ask the city to put up 2 hour parking limit on sidewalk in front of my business?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/57sonv/how_to_ask_the_city_to_put_up_2_hour_parking/,,,,,,,,

The city budget fiscal year is July 1-June 30 and proposes three Terminal 1 6 month phases, with no plan/close after 18 months, starting now on paper: ""The current proposal is to increase shelter capacity over three 6-month phases: the site will shelter 100 people in the first 6 months, 200 second 6 months, and 400 in the third 6 months."" 400 beds by July 2018, or later.

Where is Multnomah County?

You can look on these shelters as helping homeless, or you can look at them as getting camping off the streets and out of neighborhoods, or even both. 

Where is the good, aggressive, results-oriented, timely plan?
