This week, someone broke into my garage and stole two very important bikes. One was my new downhill bike that I had just spent all of my savings on so I could race next season and the other was my boyfriend's town bike that he actually built up and welded himself. We're pretty devastated about the losses, but his bike has been seen at the New Seasons on Hawthorne since it was stolen. This gives us hope that the bikes are still around town and we may be able to recover them!

[Pictures of the bikes](http://imgur.com/a/ZGEFq)

My bike was a full downhill bike; a Turner DHR (forest green), with DVO suspension (bright green), and white wheels and pedals.

His town bike is the one in the back of the bottom picture, which he hand built up from a Surly Crosscheck frame. It has a black rear triangle, with a blue/black front half. It has drop bars with neon green bar tape and white stickers all over the frame (one says ""Support your local bike shop"" another says ""blisworks bikes""). It also has yellow planet bike fenders. 

These bikes mean much more to us than just their financial worth and we would love to see them again. If you could keep an eye out for them, especially since one has already been seen, that'd be amazing. We're offering a reward for anyone who helps get them back to us.

Hoping people can keep a lookout for my wife's car:
I realize things like this get buried sometimes, but I hope I've got the proper protocol down here, posting the police case number, plate etc. Hoping someone sees it abandoned in your area and can help out:

Black Honda Civic 1998 ( Small dent on the roof of the car )
Grey interior - cassette deck
Case# 15-443855
plate: Unfortunately we don't have the plate # currently / can't remember it. (Getting it from the DMV / Police.)

Woke up to find that our 1998 black Honda Civic was stolen.
Nothing of value in the car, looks to be joyriders, as we called in a suspicious green 2000 era Honda Civic left in it's place, windows down, full of opened Christmas presents. Called in the plate and the police / owners showed up to claim the vehicle. (Which wasn't trashed!) Lucky. The thieves stole a car from a girl who had only had it three weeks, and had bought it with her babysitting money. Hope the thieves feel good about that one. They were elated to find the car, stolen from the Parkrose area, so soon.

The thieves should know: My wife is due with our first child in about 3 weeks, and now we're left with no vehicle to transport the baby in. 

If anyone sees it out there, we'd sure appreciate it if you could message here or call it in to to Portland Police non emergency.

Cheers and Happy New Year.
And even to you, car thieves.

I am a Swede (far, far away from Portland!) and as fate would have it, I am hoping to story-tell a roleplaying session in Portland, specifically in the Kenton district for world of Darkness. 

For those of you who don't know what that means, it means that I want to play a game where I tell stories with my friends and they adventure, but rather than doing it amongst dragons and dungeons they do it in our world. A darker version of our world, but our world none the less. Problem is, I have never visited Kenton (or even America for that matter!)


Now, my google fu has told me this much: Kenton used to be a company town, Vanport got completely demolished in the 1948 flood (flooding seems to be a Portland thing according to wikipedia!) and there was supposedly a Kenton ghost running around in the years before the great war.

Demographically the area isn't super-poor but far from wealthy either (I found some statistics saying 20-28% below the poverty line?), educational levels are lower than the rest of the city and people are younger there on average than in the rest of Portland. A majority of the population is white but there is a whole 5.5% who were not born in America living in Kenton (overall Portland is 1.2%). There is a little bit more crime in Kenton than in the rest of Portland, but not by much. 

The Kenton Park looks really nice and the farmers fair looks sweet too. Additionally, when I use google images for Kenton Portland most houses look quite nice. I don't exactly get the feeling of a ""poor shitty neighborhood where you need to at least be three people outside at night walking together"". I more get the feeling of ""lower middle-class area.""

So essentially, what did I get wrong? What did I get right? If you wanted to tell me something that was cool, spooky, interesting, mysterious or just plain weird specifically about Kenton, what would it be? Anything is helpful and anything you can correct me on is helpful too!

Final bonus question: If you were to describe the archetypal 'Kentoner', what would s/he be like?
