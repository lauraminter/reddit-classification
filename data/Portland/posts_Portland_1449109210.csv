I've never had such trouble finding a place to rent, but now that I have a dog, things have changed!  
  
My current lease ends mid-January (the owners want to sell the house) and I've been emailing tons of craigslisters with very few replies. I assume they're getting flooded with other potential renters (from what I've seen in the housing wanted section and heard from management companies).  
  
I'm hoping Redditors can help. I've put ads up and spoke with friends to keep an ear out, but it's stressful not knowing if I have a place to live in a month and a half!  
   
I'm 27, and work a job to keep pollution out of the sewer systems. My [dog (6yo female boxer mix) and my cat (13yo male orange tabby)](http://imgur.com/hBPlUcL) are people-lovers. As for myself, I'm pretty quiet and keep to myself in housing situations. I keep common areas clean and pay bills/rent on time.  
  
I can pay up to $600/mo and am flexible about location (but would prefer NE or SE Portland).  
  
  
Send me a PM if you've got an open room (and are fine about me not being your BFF if I move in, cause like I said, I pretty much keep to myself) so we can discuss further.  
  
I've been to Reddit game nights quite a few times and went to the Reddit Thanksgiving potluck if that makes a difference (though I'm not posting from my normal account for safety's sake for now).

Please let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post this:

Link to Pictures - http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/laf/5326770598.html

Our sweet little cat Valerie got out the afternoon of Friday 11/20 near SE 19th and Tolman in the Westmoreland neighborhood, SE part of the city. 

We've posted signs, craigslist ads, Nextdoor notifications, made daily walks, backyard searches and check the county Animal Control postings daily. A friend suggested posting to Reddit.

Valerie is all black, short hair, small (8-9 lbs), with green eyes. She had kittens in the past, so she has a bit of a hanging belly. She is chipped and was wearing a light blue leather collar. She is friendly and vocal, but might be skittish from being outside. We adopted Valerie from a shelter and recently moved the Portland with her. We were staying with family for about a week before a door was left open and she got outside, so we're also concerned that she doesn't know how to get home.

Please, if you're in the area, take 5 minutes to check under your deck and in your garage. If you have any other suggestions for finding a lost pet in Portland, I would greatly appreciate it.

Valerie was a stray who was found pregnant in a basement in Chicago in the middle of January. I like to think that means she is able to survive on her own. I am also comforted by the many outdoor cats we see each time I go out looking. Although it means many people might not think twice if they see Valerie trot through their yard, it also means that cats can be ok outdoors in Portland (this would not be true for most of Chicago).

Thanks in advance for any help or advice.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Lost Small Black Cat Blue Collar in Westmoreland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3v6ygw/lost_small_black_cat_blue_collar_in_westmoreland/,,,,,,

On my way to work this morning a 'merica'd-out Jeep (veteran bumper plate and military bumper stickers) had one of the pictured on the back of his vehicle. This is similar to waving a gun at people while driving down the road. There is no way for anyone to know if the claymore is fake or real, and considering how easy it would be to rig a remote explosive to the back of a car it should be illegal. 


I wish I had thought to snap a picture and send it to police non-emergency. Part of the reason I didn't is that I'm sure it would have been ignored as the harmless prank of a veteran. I wish I had the stones to pimp out an old Cadillac, tint the windows, mount one of these, and keep recording road stops until they impound the car.

Thanks.)

Hey, /r/portland. Like many of you, I've been renting here for years and I've been watching the rents go up. While my rental company has been pretty great, I suspect that I will be priced out of my apartment in the next couple of years. 

I've been looking into getting a house. I have excellent credit with no bad credit history, I haven't yet bought a house so I should be able to get a first time homeowner's loan with no down payment, and I've routinely paid a rent of over $1000 by myself for the past five years with no late payments. 

The problem is twofold:

* I am 100% self-employed, and it's much better for my sanity that way. I make around $100,000 a year gross; net is under $20,000, but since I work from home I am also writing off the majority of my rent, bills, car, etc. along with all the business expenses

* I have a low six figure student loan debt. I'm on an income based repayment plan, so give me another twenty-something years and all will be forgiven (except for the taxes paid on forgiven debts *sigh*)

I've talked to several real estate agents and mortgage companies. Every mortgage underwriter looks at my net income, not my gross, and declares that my debt to income ratio is too vast for anyone to give me a loan. The suggestions I have gotten are:

* Get someone to co-sign with me (I don't have anyone--I'm not married, and no one in my family is in a position to co-sign)

* Write off less on my taxes so my net income is higher (if I do this then next year my student loan payment will be higher than my rent is, and I definitely can't afford that--this is also an issue if my profit increases, which I'm trying to do anyway)

* Get a day job that somehow pays enough money to sufficiently increase my income to balance out the debt, just long enough to get approved for a loan, then quit and go back to being full-time self-employed (I already took a temporary day job for four months a couple of years ago; it took me the better part of a year to get my business' momentum to recover from me putting less time in, and no, a temporary employee is not an option. Also, that's a shitty thing to do to an employer who was anticipating a permanent employee.)

Rent to own situation are always scams, or so I understand, so that doesn't seem like a viable option. Coming up with enough cash to buy a house outright also isn't an option. I could build up a down payment over a couple of years, but I don't know if that would be enough of a help to change anyone's mind about the debt to income ratio.

All I want is someone to let me take the money I have consistently been paying my rental company, and put it into a mortgage/property tax combo instead. Are there any programs that will look at something besides my adjusted gross income on my tax return and see what I'm actually paying toward housing each month? I don't want anything fancy and wouldn't mind actually paying less per month than I do now so I can bulk up my savings more for home repairs and the like. I don't need to live in Portland proper, or even Multnomah county (though I want to stay in Oregon for a whole variety of reasons, not move to Washington).

Any suggestions? State or county programs I haven't yet heard of that could help? Mortgage companies willing to work with self-employed people? Someone wanting to give a house away?

* The image needs to be Portland or /r/Portland related.
* The image needs to be no bigger than 300x400, though we'd prefer 300x300.
* The image needs to be SFW.

* APNGs are welcome! Just keep the file size under 1mb.

Entries will be voted on by the community, and the entry with the most upvotes wins. The thread will be in contest mode so that the votes each entry has will not be visible.

As the weather started to turn we noticed the dog was still being left outside in the rain. There is a covered patio and it has a small dog bed but that's it. As soon as it got colder we starting tracking the dates and time when it would get really cold, after five dates my husband reported to the humane society since there's no shelter. We understood that the purpose of this report was to educate pet owners on the proper way to care for their animals. 

This was nearly two weeks ago and the dog is still outside and it's only getting colder. We've tried to reach out to the neighbors but there's what seems to be several families living there and nobody speaks English.

I'm interested in finding a doctor who respects my health choices, and would be open to prescribing medications like metformin proactively. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12017112/Worlds-first-anti-ageing-drug-could-see-humans-live-to-120.html

I'm a responsible person who doesn't drink, smoke, or take drugs. I'm willing to say the necessary things in order to cover them from a liability standpoint. Most doctors I've met practice a very reactive form of medicine (see a problem, try to lessen problem, document to avoid liability, repeat) rather than allowing the patient to determine how *they* want their body to function, and what *they* want out of life.

I'm in SW, but would be willing to travel. In addition to life-extending medications like metformin, I'm also interested in exploring cognitive enhancers like modafinil, sympatholytics like propranolol and prazosin, and athletic performance enhancers like clenbuterol. 

I'm willing to discuss different medications within the same class to minimize risk, what I want to avoid is being prescribed a diuretic for blood pressure instead of a beta blocker because the doctor wants to cover their butt more than they want to respect my choices regarding my own body.

(Anyone thinking of posting ""no doctor will do this"" can save their breath, as I already know people in other cities who have doctors monitoring similar regimens)

I would've posted sooner but I can't see. I was at the game and got a little too drunk, I parked north a few blocks from the arena (friend drove, don't worry). Has anyone seen them?
