In April I sold a trailer I owned at Hayden Island Homes (the manufactured home park on Jantzen Beach) with no issues, the new owners passed the parks background check and were accepted and moved in at the beginning of May. 

 As of now I have been waiting for my security deposit back for almost 45 days, [ORS 90.300](http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.300) states that landlords have 31 days to either send you your deposit back, or a notice of why you aren't getting it back (which I am, all bills were paid up).  They told me it would take a 'few weeks', but they claim to have no information when I try to follow up since it's up to corporate now and they have to send the check from Michigan.  

My question is whether or not these tenant laws apply to people who own a mobile home but rent the space that it resides on?

[This](http://www.oregon.gov/ohcs/Pages/manufactured-dwelling-park-living-resources.aspx) page suggests that they are required to follow the same rules (specifically the part that says ""Oregon Laws for Manufactured Dwelling Parks"" and lists ORS 90), however the law is so densely worded I find my self becoming more confused.  I want to make sure before I escalate the situation that they are indeed required to return my deposit within 31 days.

* Within 15 min walk of Pioneer Square

* Not too loud (we need to be able to mingle/chat)

* A place with drinks (coffee or alcoholic) would be great

I know I could just hold it in Director Park or South Park Blocks, but meeting over food/drink is always better. Thanks in advance for any suggestions! :)",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Meetup space in downtown?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/39b9ne/meetup_space_in_downtown/,,,,,

(b) An act of deviate sexual intercourse; or
(c) An act of exposing the genitals of the person with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of the person or another person.

&gt;It is unlawful for any person to expose his or her genitalia while in a public place or place visible from a public place, if the public place is open or available to persons of the opposite sex.

Nope.

With the exception of one phone call, every interaction I had with them was a frustrating hassle and packed with lies.

**FIRST:** Around a month ago, I had scheduled a fiber install. I was told that I needed to be available all day, as the tech would be in from between ""10AM to 6PM"". The tech showed up at noon, poked around and found that the contractor who was supposed to prep the area for fiber to be hooked into hadn't done it, and that nothing could be installed. I called back a few times, and found that the work had been completed the very next day, and they gave me $50 off for the hassle . 

Two weeks later, they came back and installed everything. With 1 gig up, 1 gig down, I was sitting pretty...
Until I got my first bill.

**THEN:** When I initially signed up, more than a month or so ago, I asked specifically ""$124 a month is how much total I'll be paying?"" I was told that modem rental and install fees aside, my fiber/phone package guaranteed my prices at $124 a month for three years. My first bill? Almost twice that. 

Aside from the install fee (which I was told would be waived due to their screw-ups) the $120 difference in price stems from a second install fee (for a telephone, this was not done), fees, taxes, and assorted nickel-and-dime bullshit: ""internet cost recovery fee"" and such nonsense. The $50 credit was not accounted for, and the supposedly-waived install fee was still there, at $15 more than I was told it would be.

I called; was on hold for 40 minutes and after talking to three different people, told that my actual monthly bill was ""closer to $160"" and that nothing could be done. So I've canceled my fiber. How in the fucking world can we have such amazing and powerful technology tied to such unbelievable bullshit bait-and-switch corporate hoop-jumpery? 

I can't tell if I was lied to from the get-go, if there's no communication between the salesmen and billing, or if they're a secret clown college. I will tell anyone who is curious more details.
