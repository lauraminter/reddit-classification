* There is plenty of on street parking, and the bus and streetcar stop across the street.

I get an alert the moment the listing is posted, email the owner, get an app, show up to the open house and it's a fucking madhouse. At least a dozen people there 10 minutes before the open house was scheduled to start. And after viewing the place the owner tells people that since there is so much interest he'll be giving preference to longer lease terms. Cool with me, chatted with the guy for a bit, knew it was a long shot, but felt okay. Now he's the shitty part. I'm pretty sure the guy intentionally lowered the rent on his place to get a ton of people there all excited about it, and now he's created a bidding war and has asked everyone to submit their highest/best offer by the end of the day.

[Original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/35r1o4/broadcast_radio_mystery/)  

TL;DR of the original post:  The radio signal for KISN 95.1 is completely overridden by a completely different channel when I drive by a water tower in N Portland.  Many theories were given.  

Anyway:  

For some reason I really wanted to figure out this minor mystery.  User /u/tadc had a great [theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/35r1o4/broadcast_radio_mystery/cr7aw59) that made sense to me, so I took the advice of /u/edwartica and sat in my pickup for an hour in hopes that someone would announce their station ID.  Nothing.  I did this two more times, and no one has ever come on air to announce any identification (although their [playlist](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/35r1o4/broadcast_radio_mystery/cr8tu0h) is fun and eclectic).  

This leads me to believe that it is not an example of FM Capture from KITI or KQRZ.   

Others, including /u/thediskord , suggested that perhaps someone in the neighborhood was using a low-power FM transmitter that was overriding the signal.  That seemed like the next most likely explanation, so today my offspring and I started driving in concentric circles around the water tower until we found where the signal seemed the strongest.  

The crappy antenna from a late 90s Mazda is admittedly not the most appropriate equipment with which to use for this, but we found a spot about a block away from the water tower where the signal was crystal clear.  We exited the car and started walking around looking for I don't know what--we are not experts.  However, we did find [this large antenna](http://imgur.com/RGYXCaY) extending from a garage right next to where we had parked.   Sorry for the crappy pic--I didn't want to trespass or make the house identifiable.   

So...is the signal coming from this antenna?  I'll x-post this to /r/amateurradio too.   

I think the reason I continue to pursue this is because I was so excited when [Broken Arrow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115759/) came out because it was a total Christian Slater/Samantha Mathis reunion.  But unlike Pump Up The Volume, no boobs.  Also, Broken Arrow is, like, the worst movie ever.  Figuring out this mystery offers closure somehow.

How can anyone afford to buy a house in Portland? My neighbor just sold there house for $380k.  Its just a two+ bedroom ranch, nothing fancy, no basement, under 1000k sq feet.  It's sort of a grandma house.  PDX maps listed it as $280, it went on sale at $300k and investment buyers bought it at $380k.  Unless your making some good bank, housing in Portland seems unattainable. Is it just me?  

What do you guys think?

It's fairly old but it's a steady work horse. I use it to produce music and I've been having trouble with it since April. 

When I started it up it had a disc read error every now and then and after a few reboots and self repair attempts it started up and I was able to back up everything I needed to my external. Recently the repairs are not enough to correct the problem and I believe the internal hard drive is damaged physically. I bought a replacement, same model and size. But I don't know how to install it myself with a working operating system. The new drive is installed but when I boot it up it also says disc read error. Neither drive will boot up windows and I'm at the end of my personal skills with PC's. 

I'm not great with computers but I'm not terrible at them either. I am aware it's a fairly easy self fix but my ability to do it myself is shaky at best, even with proper guidance. A Google search said that the process would require another machine to copy my windows license from and install the operating system on to the new hard drive and maybe be able to recover some files. That's the part where is over my head. I am in desperate need of having my PC fixed as it is a very crucial part of my music production. (99% of it lol) 

The downsides. I can't pay much to have this process or whatever may need to be done to get it to a functional state. But I have three alternatives methods of payment I am able to offer. 1) I can hella smoke you out on some dank buds and make you a baller ass meal. 2) I have come into some collectible swords of all shapes and sizes in fairly good condition, no rust, or breaks. We can trade. Pics on request. And 3) A flex payment over time or something. Idk how much the job is worth, I just need it done yesterday. 

If you are able and willing to help with this problem shoot me a message and some contact info and let's talk. If you also happen to have a MAC OS boot CD, that would be rad too, I have an old Mac book that has long lost its operating system after a bad partition attempt on my end. That would be awesome if I could get that working too. As for now I have no computers and I am about to go insane lol.

30 year old guy here, looking for a room while I attend Portland Community College, Cascade campus in N/NE Portland. I'll be graduating early September this year. I'll have plenty of money in savings and student loans to get me through and beyond. Currently, I live with a couple who recently got married. They're moving to a new place, which is sweet, but I have to move too :/

I don't smoke or do drugs, and don't have any pets (but I like dogs and cats). I'm very quiet and keep mostly to myself. I drive, so a place to park would be required. Internet would also be groovy.

I'm looking to move before August.

Hopefully rent (plus utilities) would be under $600/mo.
