His name is Jack. The other one is named Oscar and he is black and white and a little on the plump side. Oscar is much more chill than Jack and loves to cuddle. They are both pretty vocal, Oscar more so than Jack.

They are free to a good home, preferably someone who has the time to give them the attention they need. 

There are a few catches. One, they need to go to the same home, as they are litter mates and are quite attached to each other (they lost their mother before they were weened so Oscar often tries to nurse on Jack, for example). Two, they need their last round of vaccinations and probably a general check up with the vet. Three, you need to have your own kitty carrier.

Does New Seasons always screw up the bill?  I'm looking at you Cedar Hills store.

I've finally learned to _always_ double check the meat counter.  Often they ring things up as the wrong item (buy chicken, pay duck price).

Tonight I double checked the meat counter, but the checker double rung my milk.  What good was the coupon for a free gallon, if you ring it up twice?

I can forgive the occasional mistake.  In fairness they are always good at fixing the error, when I go back, but this feels like it's happening _every_ trip to the store.

I'm trying to explore this question from a sociological perspective, and a comment on that article had an interesting point:
&gt;the reason Oregon is number one is because of the high minimum wage, burdensome taxes on business, and burdensome regulations --- all leading to high unemployment. 

And how does a state like Washington ([with only .4% less unemployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income#States_ranked_by_median_household_income)) use so [many fewer food stamps?](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/states-with-the-highest-percentage-of-residents-on-food-stamps/article/2557800) Simply because of [median income?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income#States_ranked_by_median_household_income)

Can somebody explain all the correlations a little bit better? Is the sole cause unemployment, or are there more factors? And in a perfect world, what would be the best strategy or policy to alleviate these issues in Oregon?
