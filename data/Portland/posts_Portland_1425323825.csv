Anyone who is a fan knows they are coming to Keller in April.  Tickets are sold out, and on Stubhub they are going for 200% of face value.

You snooze you lose, right?  Read on...

Back in August, we learned that our daughter (2 months old at the time) had a rare disease of the biliary tree called Biliary Atresia that would required an emergency surgery (called a Kasai procedure) to correct.  The correction only works about 1/3 of the time, and for those lucky 33.3%, only 33.3% of them cruise on into adulthood without further intervention.  The rest need a liver transplant, either soon, or within the first few years.  Our daughter fell in the first 2/3 where the emergency surgery didn't help.  The last 6 months have been spent waiting for a liver transplant and keeping her healthy.

I'm happy to report she's had a transplant and doing very well, and we should get to go home to Portland in little more than a month.

All that being said, I missed out.  I was definitely focused on the right thing,  so I don't feel bad.  However, I thought I'd put out feelers.  If you have an extra ticket to sell, or know of any other way, I'd be eternally grateful.

TL;DR Baby daughter was very sick and needed transplant.  While caring for her, missed out on dream of getting Faith No More tickets.

Hello Portland,

I have had my two cats for many years, but unfortunately one has always bullied the other. I have tried every behavior modification technique on the planet, but it really has just gotten worse over the years, and as horrible as I feel for this decision, I really think that my cat would be happier in a new, cat-free home. Every day my other cat attacks her randomly and tries to control her access to food and the litterboxes. I can't look for a new home for the bully as he has special health needs, so unfortunately I need to look for a new home for her.

She is spayed, about 8 years old, and very sweet, funny, and playful. If you drag a long ribbon around your house she'll have a ton of fun chasing it. She has just been to the vet last week and is in perfect health, with all of her shots up to date. She is a touch overweight, but it should be easy to get that off (I overfed my cats to try to keep the peace). She sheds so you'll have to be prepared for a bit of fur around.

An ideal home wouldn't have other pets, but chill dogs would be okay. She is fine with my dogs as they don't bother her. I also don't recommend small children as she doesn't enjoy rough handling, but if you are gentle to her she will enjoy nothing more than curling up in your lap. I would like her to stay an indoor cat only, she was once a stray so if you let her out, you may not see her again.

I can provide some starter supplies (some food, an automatic feeder, and some toys).

Please contact me if you think you could provide a loving home for her!  Thank you!",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Looking for a new home for my sweet cat.
