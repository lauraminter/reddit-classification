I've finally got my own place! No roommates who leave dish mountain and flood the bathroom with pubes. No loud parties on work nights when you've been working doubles. But also.... No spare cash.

 At all. 

For anything. 

Emergencies? Nope.

So, I'm curious, has anyone ever just rented out a room purely for the purpose of storage?
I am absolutely *not* looking for a roommate. But to put the extra room to use - since I only need one - while snagging some extra cash a month seems like a swell idea to me if it would gain any interest.
Aside from throwing it up on Craigslist, is there anywhere else you folks might have listed/seen something like this listed?
Is there even any interest in something like this? Is it even a good idea? (Obviously I'd draft up a contract and there'd be a lock on that door that only they have a key to.)
How would one price something like this?

This might be a truly stupid idea that I need to toss out the window, but I thought it worth at least a shot.
Knowing the Portland rental market is how it is... Is the Portland storage market as treacherous? (I'm guessing no.)",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,default,Renting a room as storage?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3g7npu/renting_a_room_as_storage/,,,,,

Supposedly you can sue someone for twice the value of a non-refundable housing deposit. Has anyone ever done this successfully? A non-refundable deposit seems like something that would be easy to document and bring someone to court for.

Fees are allowed, but only for [certain things](http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.302http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/90.302), and it seems like it would be fairly easy to prove that a non-refundable deposit was not paid as one of those fees.

The only other loophole I can see (as someone with no legal expertise) in the law covering deposits is that landlords can deduct money from your deposit for carpet cleaning even if you have already cleaned the carpet before handing in your keys. But as long as you submitted written notice to them asking for an itemized list of what they spent your deposit on, they would only be able to keep that non-refundable deposit if they actually spent that amount of money on legitimate expenses. Still, I imagine if you submitted a stock letter to a landlord asking for your deposit back or an itemized list of expenses, they might just forget about the non-refundable housing deposit.

To me the main problem with this is that you end up pissing off someone listed on your rental history in exchange for the possibility of winning $100-300 (depending on the size of your ""non-refundable deposit,"" obviously) in a settlement. Which, considering how competitive the Portland housing market is, probably isn't the best trade off.

If you have any legal information about this process or if you have gone through it yourself, I would love it hear it.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Has anyone had any success fighting non-refundable deposits?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3g7iw1/has_anyone_had_any_success_fighting_nonrefundable/,,,,,

It inspired me to write a little bit of my thoughts on the matter, and given our lively discussions on the whole transplant and native thing, I thought it might be appropriate to share.

&gt;As a seventh-generation Oregonian, it's not that I hate transplants, as I wouldn't be alive had my dad not decided to move to Portland decades ago, but that I am wary of their intentions. It's not transplants with whom I have a problem, but people who move here to experience our culture, but without truly giving back. Those folks are like leeches sucking Portland's creativity dry. On the other hand, Portland's creativity has been a draw for people who truly love Portland and all it stands for and want to embrace and grow with our city. These are the people I welcome, people who will continue to breathe life and love into our little corner of the world our ancestors have spent generations tending to.


&gt;Some people might divide those who live here into categories, transplants and natives, but unless you have true native ancestors, then even that distinction is dubious. A much truer line is drawn between those who come here to give, and those who come to take. People who come here to give back to our arts and history are in the former category, while those fleeing California's high rents and merely enjoy the benefits our artists have made fall into the latter. Often, these divides also fall along class and moneyed lines as well, although this isn't always the case. In many cases, though, your starving artists come here to make something better for themselves and the community, while more well off individuals come merely for culture and wealth extraction. They see Portland as a cheap and interesting place to live, while gutting exactly what makes the city so.


&gt;I've seen this distinction between givers and takers play out in my own house in North Portland. On one hand, we had a native Oregonian who moved up to Portland merely to more or less ""retire"" as a starving artist, but without truly giving back to the community, instead leeching from its culture and goodwill. On the other hand, a dancer from clear across the US who came to Portland to give back to our city's thriving dance scene and make a name for herself. It goes without saying, that I preferred the transplant to the Oregonian, as she was a giver, and he was a taker.

&gt;So long as we have more givers moving to Portland, we can continue to grow as the vibrant city that we are, but once the tide has turned to value-seeking wealth extractors and leeching youth without drive and purpose, then Portland will have finally jumped the shark.

&gt;Portland has changed significantly since my childhood, and even since I was a teenager growing up here, but so long as we can continue to change for the better, I think we'll be okay.

He spoke with an employee and she said someone named Nick found money and left his phone number. He said to call with the amount that was lost... but the number was a wrong number! 

We're both panicking. I am on the way the medical center to see if the note possibly has bad hand writing and my boyfriend was given the wrong number over the phone when he called. 

I'm really hoping Nick is out there and we can get the right number for him. Without the money from the payday loan our rent check is going to bounce and then we will have the fees associated with that. 

Thanks so much for any help finding Nick and our money.

In the past month, we have called the nuisance line 3x and filed a suspicious activity report online to the Portland Police. This house constantly has people coming and going, visitors will sit and idle in the middle of street with very loud bass like mufflers and then SPEED off as fast as they can down our street. They blast music at all hours of the day. As I am typing this I can hear them playing JLO over my radio and its somewhat loud already. I wouldn't be surprised if all of SE could hear their music. 


I know people are going to say, ""Why don't you talk to them?""
Well, we have spoken to many neighbors already who have lived on this block for years and every one has had issues with this particular house. One neighbor had a gun pulled on him. They're rude and unresponsive. Another neighbor confronted them and it resulted in a shouting match and nothing was done.  So to be honest, we are a bit afraid of confrontation and don't want to create any type of retaliation of any sort. What can we do to get the police or citys attention on this matter? Like I said, basically everyone on our block has issues with this particular house and the neighborhood would really improve with some nicer neighbors. 

Also, the house is owned, not rented out. So, there is no way to contact a landlord to evict tenants. I found out the name and info of the owner online, and have asked some neighbors if they've spoken to him directly, refer to the top when I wrote things turned into a shouting match/drama/gun whatever.
