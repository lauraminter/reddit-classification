Hello, 

I know this isn't your fault but  rather the disgusting person living below us possibly beside? I can't use my patio because the person who lives below us (or beside) smokes a lot of weed and its comes right up to our  apartment. My furniture is now infused with that nasty smell. I can not enjoy my home now. I had to use air freshener OUTSIDE! Within that minute the smell traveled slightly into my own apartment. This smell lingers everywhere here. I'm tired of it. It makes me nauseous and it smell like 1,000 skunks. I feel if this can not be resolved we may have to look for something more suitable and with class. These people make my home feel nasty. I can not stand this anymore. I understand if you can not do too much but if an apartment smelled like pure garbage wouldn't you be able to give them warnings? Its just miserable and makes me hate this apartment. 

Their reply: 
I am truly sorry for any inconvenience you are experiencing. I do agree and I don't think you should have to deal with other people's bad choices. On the other hand I can't really do much. With marijuana being decriminalized multonomah county isn't prosecuting for it anymore. I've been told specifically all I'm legally allowed to do is treat it like ciggerate smoke and ask them to smoke outside. I can and will ask them to be Respectful of others. But with the new laws, they have a right to smoke on their patio. 

I will talk to my boss to see if we can come up with a solution. 

I really am sorry and I will do what I can to resolve it.
______________________________________

They were really nice in their response, but I shouldn't have to suffer through that smell. It makes me want to vomit and feel dirty. Due to this it's making me look hard for a house to rent so I have more control. Is anyone else experiencing this? (To clear up I'm not against people doing it but I am once it effects me. Now I have no power over my own paid for environment) are there any parts of town where people are classier about it and keep the smell to themselves?  

Edit: 

So I found my contract and did sign a non-smoking addendum. It states that people are allowed to smoke only on their patios where it comes up to my apartment. We are looking for a house to rent or smoke free apartments (outside of Portland) thanks for the comments. I will be speaking further to my landlord. At least we can get a puppy with a new apartment yay bright side ",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,default,Problems with legalization (and now being helpless),http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2z12a0/problems_with_legalization_and_now_being_helpless/,,,1426360084.0

Today I witnessed a neighbor grab his black lab by it's head-skin and pull it up stairs, while screaming at the dog. I was about 100 ft away and 90% sure he didn't just grab the dog's collar, but 90% isn't enough for me to call the authorities.

The yelling isn't abnormal for the dog owner. About every other day I hear this man (male, late 30's/early 40's, bald, average build) yelling, quite angrily, at the top of his lungs while taking the dog on a walk. The dog is pretty well behaved but, for some reason, the owner doesn't use a leash. I have lived in the area (SE Sunnyside) for more than a year and this is a near daily occurrence. When friends from out of town are visiting and they hear this screaming, they ask aloud 'Who is being murdered?'. 'It's just the neighborhood rage-a-holic unloading his life's frustration on a dog.' I've never seen anything physically violent before, but after hearing a 'grown' ass man screeching at his dog at 1100 am this often, at some point I stopped rushing to the window. 

Has anyone got any first hand advice to share? Has anyone had constructive interactions with local animal/law enforcement resources in this type of situation? 

A video will be difficult for me to get due to the distance and the vantage point. Confronting him directly is an option, but, on a side note, whenever I  attempt a neighborly nod when walking by, all that is returned is a very confrontational stare. Overall, this dude gives me a creepy vibe, but by all appearances has a wife and looks pretty straight-laced.

It would be dope if you could make it to the meeting (if they make a new one), but just as dope for them to know that there are people out there watching that want to make sure they give the public more of a chance to speak their mind on these issues.

That is why I am reaching out to you now.

My cousin and best friend Sean Kosky disappeared under suspicious circumstances. He was 24 years old, staying temporarily at a family member’s house in the Miller woods near McMinnville, OR. His disappearance was reported by my cousin who noted his wallet and epilepsy medication were left behind - unusual for him - and that there was no indication that he would have left on his own. Multiple search and rescue teams spent days scouring the woods and the surrounding area...but Sean was never found. 

Sean was severely epileptic and needed supervision and care because of his seizures. But Sean was also caring, intelligent, open-minded, and a friend to every person that accepted him into their lives. Sean loved being with his friends, nature, playing chess, making people laugh, he stood up for those he cared about, and loved his family above all else. He was the type of person that reflects the positive values of the Reddit community. 

I’m reaching out to Reddit because my family and I need closure. The search and rescue was unsuccessful and the police case wasn’t thorough. We still don’t know what happened to Sean or where his body may be. In the hopes of solving the mystery behind Sean’s disappearance, I’ve started raising money to hire a Private Investigator who will be able to devote the time and resources to this case that Sean deserves. And, to donate any of the money collected, beyond what is needed, to The National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, (the link to the fundraiser page can be found in the News Register article posted below).

I am also reaching out to Reddit for ANY information you may have on this case. I hope this interests you enough to look into it and help in any way that you can. We will be providing updates and case evidence once we retain the PI to keep everyone involved and provided with insight.

Please help us find our beloved son, brother, nephew, uncle, cousin, grandson, and friend. Help us bring Sean home.

Thank you❤️

I live off Holgate Boulevard, and I was driving down Holgate toward the river at twilight. The sun was just below the horizon, and the combination of the glare of sunset and the headlights of the oncoming cars made visibility tough. 

So I'm approaching 41st Avenue in these conditions, when suddenly I see that I am barreling toward a bicyclist stopped in the middle of the street.

Stopped.

In the middle of the street.

With his arm stuck out, because he was making a left turn onto 41st, sitting in the goddamn middle of the goddamn street, behaving like he was in a car.

His safety lighting consisted of one blinking red LED, the lens so grimy from regular commuting that it could barely be seen - telling me that this tool rides enough to know better, you'd think - and was partially obscured by one of his panniers to boot. With the headlights of the oncoming cars and the glare of twilight, he was damn near invisible.

I happened to notice him at the last possible second that gave me enough reaction time to stop the car. As I'm braking hard, time slows to a crawl - I'm thinking to myself, ""This is what it's like to run a man down in the street. My God, I will be responsible for someone's death tonight."" In that brief time, not my life, but HIS flashed before my eyes. Does he have a family? Will he be crippled for life, or killed? Perhaps he's a small business owner. What will happen to his employees?

Well, he didn't die - I screeched to a halt right on his back wheel. He found his opening and made his precious left turn. He didn't even look over his shoulder - I don't think he even knows how close to death he came. As he pulled away, and I regained my composure and drove away as well, my panic turned to anger.

""You sonofabitch! YOU almost got YOURSELF killed by being an entitled asshole, acting like you're a car! I would have had your death or maiming on my conscience for the rest of my life! How dare you do that to ME?""

I thought it was an isolated incident, but a week ago, my wife and I are walking the dog past that same corner, and TWO bicyclists are doing the same thing: heading west with terrible visibility thanks to sunset glare, at an intersection that is just over a slight rise in the road (one reason I didn't see this guy at first), sitting in the middle of the goddamn road at 41st waiting to make a left turn the way someone in a car would, minus the two tons of protective steel, and with quite insufficient lighting on their bikes.

I know you bike commuters are all awesome and everything, but really? REALLY?!? 

When I was a kid, I was taught to walk my bicycle across such an intersection. I suppose such rules don't apply when you are an awesome Portland bike commuter with a well-used commuter bike that shows your commitment to not driving. If you're that committed, **QUIT ACTING LIKE YOU'RE IN A FUCKING CAR WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ROAD. YOU WILL DIE.** And someone like me, who didn't wake up that morning planning to kill a man before bedtime, will have your death on his conscience. And you would be remembered as a dead asshole whose entitled obliviousness got him killed.
