[More](http://bikeportland.org/2015/05/11/protest-se-powell-slows-traffic-draws-big-crowd-143079#comments)

The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is the agency almost completely responsible for the conditions on Powell Blvd. It has consistently refused to prioritize safety on Powell, prioritizing motor vehicle capacity instead.

This is why we are organizing a ""Die-in!"" at ODOT Region 1 headquarters downtown. We will show the deadly consequences of ODOT's priorities by acting as the dead and wounded victims of crashes on Powell Blvd. Please bring a white shirt that you are willing to have stains on if you are able; we will bring fake blood!

More info about ODOT: We believe ODOT, with its focus on auto capacity and transport between cities, is the wrong agency to control arterials within cities.

ODOT has consistently prioritized auto capacity over lives. This is why 26th Ave. does not have a left-turn signal at Powell, which would have prevented this accident. In the past, ODOT refused to put in a left-turn signal because it would slow down cars on Powell. How many limbs and lives does it take to be worth a few seconds or minutes?
The problems on Powell are not isolated to the area around 26th. Indeed, Powell is more neglected and deadly in East Portland. There are no sidewalks on Powell in the vast majority of its length past I-205. Marked crosswalks are few and far between.

This is why are calling on the state legislature to pass a bill to transfer Powell and the other urban state highways in Portland to the control of the City of Portland. We are also calling on ODOT to prioritize funding to bring Powell and the other urban state highways up to standards minimally sufficient for city life (sidewalks and crosswalks would be a good start). The City's Bureau of Transportation, though not perfect, is at least more directly responsive to local safety concerns than ODOT.

I was involved in an unfortunate accident yesterday on my way home from work. A seriously intoxicated homeless man ran out from the side of the street and ran right into the side of my car while I was driving, going about 20-25MPH. I followed procedure and have contacted insurance and I have a case number from the Portland Police. I did not receive a citation. I have one witness and his contact information.

According to multiple accounts, the man was kicked out of the homeless shelter across the street for being too drunk/on drugs/what have you. He then went across the street to MFP to bum a cigarette off someone, and then he started twirling around and ran into the middle of traffic, right into the side of my car.

To reiterate, I did not hit him; he hit my driver side with his body. He hit the side of my car. I did not hit him with the front of my car. The first I saw of him was when he was mashed up against my driver side window, taking my mirror with him as he flew to the ground.

If anyone else was there and saw what happened, please PM me. I know there were plenty of people outside the bars. It was at about 6:10 PM north of SE Washington on SE Grand by My Father's Place and Slow Bar.

I'm super shaken up about it and just want to have as many people on my side. Thanks!

This would be a [sealed deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/sealeddeck) thing, and would be very new player friendly. Here's basically how it will work:


You open any 6 booster packs from the latest block (Khans of Tarkir, Fate Reforged, Dragons of Tarkir) and build a 40 card deck from the cards in those boosters, adding as many basic lands as you need. (see me or a game shop if you need those. Most places will give them to you for free if you need them) Keep that deck together in a box or somewhere safe apart from the rest of your cards, and play some games! We'll pair up people for 3+ rounds of [swiss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament), and then you can schedule matches with your opponents for a time and place that's convenient to you. After playing at least one match a week for three or more rounds, I'll give out some prizes to the highest placed players. 

I think it would take a minimum of 8 players to get something like this going, so is anyone interested?

KISN is back on the air at 95.1 FM and I've been listening to it in the car a lot lately.  The only commercials they play are vintage ones from the '50s-'70s and they sometimes play some really obscure 45s.  The signal is pretty crappy in places but it's fine for the most part.  

However, whenever I'm within a couple blocks of [this water tower](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St+Johns,+Portland,+OR/@45.5861755,-122.751264,113m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x5495a84779186d51:0xd61734557b61c113), the signal is completely overridden by an entirely *different* radio station.  Upon approaching this tower, the Tommy James and the Shondells song will disappear and a random Fleetwood Mac song will come on, for example.  And then a block or so later, KISN FM will come back on.  I guess it's just a little eerie.  

My theory is that someone in the neighborhood is running a low-output pirate radio station, or perhaps the [antennae on the water tower itself](https://www.google.com/maps/@45.586068,-122.751573,3a,75y,22.37h,116.13t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sTkjj87yCHjNfGe1S9Pm7zw!2e0!6m1!1e1) are causing interference.

).  Right now our entire team is located in the Portland area, and we'd like to keep it that way!  

In XO you command a ragtag fleet of starships against an unbeatable enemy. It's an innovative, real-time strategy game with a focus on fleet tactics, a complex political system, and features several procedural elements for re-playability.  We're drawing inspiration from other sci-fi works like Battlestar Galactica and Ender's Game, and rogue-like games such as FTL.  The game will be released on the PC, Mac and Linux.

For more information on the gameplay, visit our pitch on [Square Enix Collective](http://collective.square-enix.com/projects/123/xo
)

XO will require clever, striking sounds to match the stylish visuals that are already in place.  We're interested in using experimental methods to create unique, sci-fi SFX, electronic sounds, ambience, and voices that bring this universe to life.  We love the work of Ben Burtt (Star Wars, WALL-E) and want to bring his style of original and unconventional methods into this game.  

The entire project will be done as work for hire for Jumpdrive Studios. We would be delighted to act as a reference and will allow you to refer to us and use this project as a case study/white paper and/or submit it for awards.  You will be credited in the game and throughout the social &amp; marketing campaigns for XO.  

Here's an overview of the sounds we're looking for:
Holographic console UI sounds
Ambient sci-fi sounds and motifs
Glitch effects for transmissions and broken communications
Starship jump drives
Spaceship thrusters
Weapons firing (lasers, flak cannons, particle accelerators, missles)
Impact and explosions
Forcefields 

We're looking for someone who is going to be as hungry and dedicated as we are.  We obsess over minor details to get the game feeling just right.  If this sounds like how you work, then we want to hear from you! Previous experience working on video games is a huge plus.  You must be able to provide examples of your previous work, and we are not looking for any music – composers, please look elsewhere!

I figure I would need something tall enough to fix my class C motorhome in with me standing up on top and with enough room around the RV so put ladders, tables, etc. I would also need access to electricity for power tools. I can probably get the work done in a month or so, so something I could rent month to month or week to week would be ideal.
 
I've been searching around to see about renting some sort of space like that somewhere here in the portland area, but I'm finding it a hard thing to google for.

So I moved here to the Portland area in the last year and every time I've been to Powell's Bookstore downtown I keep seeing the same homeless girl. She sits outside the front entrance on Burnside with a sign asking for $20 for a room for her and her cat. 

I'm curious if anyone knows her story. Part of me feels bad and wants to help by paying for some food for her and the cat. But the other pat of me feels like the weird $20 sign request makes it seem like there is more to the scenario and she may not be so needy (I need help, but only need 20's for a room?). Maybe I'm just not used to homeless people and she does really need help. Just curious for more info, thanks.

* [Here’s pictures of past events.](https://www.facebook.com/dicedrinks/photos_stream)

* Minors are allowed, but only in the diner section, until 10pm.

* There is plenty of on street parking, and the bus and streetcar stop across the street.


* [We have a Facebook page.](http://facebook.com/dicedrinks) ""Like"" it for event reminders, pics, and related discussions.

We play party games and strategy games. You can bring your own or play with one of [our 160 games.](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/dicedrinks?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;gallery=large&amp;ff=1) 

Don't worry if you've never heard of any of these games! The same is true for most people that come and we're happy to teach. This meetup is more about socializing with your fellow Redditors than hardcore gaming.

If you've not heard of CENTRL, it's a new co-working space in the heart of the Pearl (centrloffice.com) with fantastic amenities like showers, free coffee and beer, great community events, and a good mix of a professional yet laid-back vibe.

We're currently looking to fill 2 desks in our private office by the end of the month. If you're a 2 person team, or just an individual this could be a great fit. The office has all you need to move in and start working.

About us: I'm working on a startup, and the other tenant is a professional photographer. There are 2 desks open in our office and the rent is $495/month each.

Let me know if your interested! These spaces go quickly, and there is a waitlist for private offices so we'd love to keep ours and find some awesome new PDX folks to share the office with.

Contract is directly with centrl and is month to month.

Less open parking lots Yay! No word how many will be two bedroom, but it looks like most will be studios/single bedroom : (

While it's exciting to see all the new stuff being built here in inner SE, I am kind of troubled that developers are cutting corners on parking, especially bike parking. From how I read the regulations this development requires 34.65 parking spaces. And the developer can decrease this number by bicycle, motorcycle, transit plaza, etc, up to a maximum of 50%

The proposed plan calls for 17 spots to be shared among the 105+ residents, 3 retail spaces and potentially a restaurant or larger retailer.... Am I the only one upset that they are trying to use hanging bike racks as a substitute for real bike parking?

I'm looking for a quiet, responsible, and tidy female for a roommate. I'm in my 30's and would like to have a roommate in her mid 20's or older. A little about me: I'm an easygoing, busy, quiet and friendly. I have a cat. I'm a student and I work. In my down time, I volunteer at a research center and a nonprofit animal shelter. When it comes to home life, I'm usually crazy busy with school work or doing yoga, reading a book or on my way out to meet with friends. I don't do much partying but when I do it's while I'm out. I'm looking for a roommate who is similar in that way. I seldom have people over. I don't have overnight guests generally but I'll give fair warning if I do because I try to be respectful of my roommate's needs. If anyone is over it's usually for tea, coffee or wine and it's one or two other people. Home, for me, is a place where I can put my stuff, relax, meditate, and watch movies on Netflix. In short, it's my haven. I'd like someone who is gets that. Also, I'm a vegetarian so I'm kinda hoping to keep it a meat free zone but I'm pretty flexible. I'm queer and kink friendly. 

The apartment is in the Laurelhurst neighborhood. It's located near bus lines 12, 19 and 20. It's also close to the SE Ankeny bike path. The apartment comes with off-street parking and there is a small storage space for the unit. The room is unfurnished, as are the living room and dining room spaces. 

 Please contact me if you think you'd be a good fit!
