Moved here about a year ago and one night I was browsing meetup.com. Saw there was a Virtual Reality meetup and decided to try it out. To make a story short, I feel in love and  I ordered my Oculus Rift DK2 the very next day.

Since then, about 8 months now, all I think about is Virtual Reality and its potential. I have met some very cool people in the community, both in person and in VR, experience some very amazing demos and have even started developing two of my own projects.

I figure that maybe the surrounding area of portland would like to try it out and see the wonderful world of VR. I just got back from going back home and having people try it out there. The event was a success, about 40 people shown up, an not one of them didnt like it. Well my dad did get nausea on the rollercoaster demo.

I signed up for Hood to Coast relay race and the Portland Marathon this year. I'm a seasoned runner but this is my first marathon.  When I recently moved to the top of a mountain and began training, I really did a number on my knees with the downhill running. As in, I now drive to the bottom of the hill or to the Springwater Corridor to run anything more that 4 miles. I have had no previous injuries with my knees before and unfortunately, the days of having a collegiate trainer are long gone. I used to see a massage therapist back east who did what I believe neuromuscular massages under the table for my boyfriend and me. They were painfully awesome and really helped maintain my legs. I was hoping to find some similar situation as my insurance sucks and most likely probably definitely will NOT cover this expense. I'm halfway through to the Marathon and I'm terrified I won't be able to compete in these races because my knees hurt so bad!

PM me if you can help or know someone. I know that advertising for under the table stuff isn't a good idea and I don't want to get you in trouble. I can easily pay for the services: cash, paypal, beer and pizza, whatever. Don't bother me with sketchy shit with no credentials.

I'm a college student thats been in the USA for around 3 years now and have just sold my motorcycle. During my general riding I've encountered 2 gentlemen that purchased their motorcycles via police auction. I've tried googling but all I really seem to get is advice to look around locally. Anyway So I guess this is me reaching out. I've never been to an auction and I have no idea what to look for except that there need to be motorcycles up for sale. Do i need some sort of business licence to participate? Can anyone send me in the right direction/ help me out a little? Maybe let me tag along next time you go to one?

Address:

Handicapped accessible, Trimet routes 19, 70 and 33, stop number 3933

If you can't make this meeting, have no fear! We'll be meeting each TUESDAY at 7pm to 'kick the can down the road'. Our weekly meetings will have different weekly foci, such as large scale art and signage, strategic planning for large and small events, service projects large and small, and a policies workshop where we will work more in depth to understand Sen Sanders policy positions and be ready to present them in the world.

BerniePDX.us is a volunteer organization that will not take donations, allowing us to work with and separately from the campaign. We believe that service in our own communities is the key to raising visibility for Bernie, and we aim to have small, medium and large projects for people to plug into, such as neighborhood cleanup, volunteering for the Oregon Food Bank and REACH, and several music/entertainment gatherings.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,"berniepdx.us strategic planning meeting for Bernie's visit next week!

I've seen great things happen from the people you can reach on Reddit. So I'm hoping another miracle can be worked to find my buddy Peanut.

My buddy Kyle and his girlfriend left him with a friend for the weekend. The two of them had booked a get away trip up to Vancouver, BC. A friend took Peanut to Cannon Beach for the day and had him when they left the beach to drive back. They put him in the back of a truck and, well, Peanut somehow Houdini'd out of it.  He was lost some where on Highway 26 headed back to Portland.
If you guys have any information, we would be so grateful! Please PM me with any information.

I am an Australian living in Vancouver. We are planning on going to Portland for the long weekend. I will be with another Australian, an American, an Irish and a Canadian. 

We are looking for a place to crash. Even if it is only a couple of us. My friend knows somebody but he is not able to host all 5 of us. I have tried couchsurfting but everybody who can host is hosting. We also have a tent so three of us could sleep in the backyard.

We are all good company to have around and really easy going.

Update: we found her!! Thank you for all your help! She managed to find her way back to the yard and some people walking by knocked on our door to let us know. She is safe and well and very thirsty. 


Hi r/Portland

http://imgur.com/EpWy6nV,ldIPHiP

My friend's cat Waffles went missing last night. She is probably around 40-50th ave and Hawthorne. She is a one year old cat, but she is very small for her age. She has a big fluffy squirrel tail. She is skittish, but not prone to attack. If you see her or by some miracle catch her, please call us at one of these numbers and we'll come pick her up.
