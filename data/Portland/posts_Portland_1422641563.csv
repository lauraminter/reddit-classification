It started Wednesday morning when I was woken up by the two of them rumbling around on my roof at about 6am. I had no idea what was going on, but I had seen raccoons in my backyard at night, which is no big deal as they are nocturnal. These two, though - they were hissing and screeching at each other while stomping around on the roof right above my bed in the wee hours of the morning. Such a lovely sound to be awoken to. I went outside and clapped and yelled and even turned the hose on them to get them to scatter away, and they did - or so I thought.

My deck, which butts up right to some sliding glass doors on the north wall of my bedroom, has a tree growing out of it to hide some power lines. There is an area cut out of the deck itself to allow the tree to grow properly, and there is apparently enough of a gap for medium-sized raccoons to squeeze in there and get cozy. While I thought I had scared the two raccoons off my roof Wednesday morning, they had in fact taken up residence underneath my damn deck. How do I know that without seeing them? Because these two little fuckers liked to fight constantly, chattering and screeching at each other at all hours of the day.

Fast forward to last (Thursday) night. I decide to take matters into my own hands and flush my two new friends out of their den. I put a bluetooth speaker out on the deck, facing down on where I suspect them to be. I then put on a podcast - Sklarboro Country - in the hopes that the constant talking would annoy them, as I had read that is an effective way to disturb them and to get them to leave their den (leaving on talk radio or something similar). After about 40 minutes or so, I start to see them both emerge from the gap in my deck. Let me tell you - there's nothing quite like seeing an almost 30-pound wild animal emerge from underneath your deck, staring right at you the whole time. I immediately plugged the gap with some leftover wood I had laying around, making sure not to leave enough of a gap for them to return.

I am new to this part of town - Roseway/Cully - and did not have many raccoon problems where I used to live in John's Landing. Does anyones else have problems with them or have any tips for keeping them away? I own two cats (*ladies*) but I keep their food inside. This is why I decided to drive out the raccoons in the first place - the cats both very much enjoy going outside, and I don't need them getting attacked and/or eaten by some hungry raccoons. 

*Aww, why did you bug them? They just wanted to hang under the deck!* These two were constantly fighting and screeching at each other, day and night. It was not pleasant. I suspect it was a male/female pair. When they finally came out from under the deck, the first raccoon batted and hissed at the second one as it came out. Raccoons can be very remarkable animals, and I have them no problem with them walking quietly along the fence at night, but these two were not pleasant at all. They had to go - I like my cats with all four of their limbs.

Hopefully this was somewhat interesting. I wish I had some pictures of the two raccoons, but it was too dark out last night to get any good ones. As well, the fact that they were rumbling around during the day makes me think they were rabid or something nasty along those lines. I haven't really seen this mentioned around /r/Portland, so I thought I'd share my experience.

Last month, our downstairs neighbor reported water damage to the ceiling of her unit, and the source of the leak was my roommate's bathtub/shower.

The plumber found two possible causes of the leak:
1. The gasket connecting the tub to the overflow drain was loose, so water could have leaked if the tub was filled above the overflow drain (and my roommate admits to having filled the tub that full, so this is probably the cause).
2. He found a significant amount of water on the floor next to the tub, presumably from the shower my roommate had taken that morning, and the plumber suggested that water may have leaked through cracks in the caulking between the tub and the floor. (This seems less likely to have caused the leak.)

I'm trying to decide if it's fair to ask my roommate to split the $550 plumber bill with me. Obviously it's my responsibility to keep the tub in working order. I don't know how that gasket came loose -- it's possible it's been that way since I bought the place, and it's just never been an issue before because I've never filled the tub that full. The cracks in the caulking are also my responsibility, but again, it wouldn't be an issue if I were using that bathroom, because I would never let water pool on the floor.

What do you think? Is it legally and socially appropriate to ask my roommate to chip in?

 It IS fiber to junction because they can't do fiber to home in apartments without permits. The junction is on the corner right out front my place.

Unbeknownst to me, OPB has taken to sending people to your house if you have donated in the past then stopped. 

 Last night, my partner left the house in the car and just a minute or two later I heard an urgent knock on the door and someone grabbing the door handle and rattling the door a bit. I thought it was my partner (who might have forgot something and was in a huge hurry)... so I opened the door. 

 The dogs were going NUTS and what I see isn't my partner, it's a man in a trench coat with an OPB badge around his neck. He wants to see ________ who was my partner's mom and died over a year ago. Apparently _________ had donated to OPB in the past, and was on a list so they sent someone to ask for money. (I found this later when I called OPB to complain).
  When I opened the door the dude (older, about 60ish) sort of put his hand on the screen door as if he was going to come on in, like I had invited him in, although I was just holding the door open only enough to speak to the man. He was ignoring the dogs wanting to rip him into shreds, and I had to point out the NO SOLICITING and BEWARE OF DOG signs that were right by the doorbell, which he also ignored. 

 Despite the OPB badge the whole thing felt as if it could go sideways any second (who comes to your door after dark in a trench coat?!) so I said NO SOLICITING! Can't you read the sign?!   and then I shut the door.

I have called OPB and told them I was pretty unhappy by the way this guy knocked insistently and how he sort of had his foot in the door. Who invites themselves into a house where two big mean looking dogs are slobbering all over themselves to get a piece of you?
  Anyhow, just wanted to warn you folks that OPB is sending people to houses now. Don't shoot them LOL

I have two tickets to Patton Oswalt at the Newmark Theatre at 8PM tonight.  They are Orchestra level tickets, row J to be specific.  I am offering these for $98.  I paid $97.50 for them, so I am not marking these up.  Okay, I marked them up by 50 cents, to make an even number but if you are going to be a stickler, I would sell them for $97.50.

I am not feeling very well, which is why I am selling these.  I have etickets and would STRONGLY prefer to do this transaction online.  You paypal me money, I email you the tickets.  I know that this doesn't really signify much, but I do sell and buy things regularly on /r/makeupexhange.

If you don't feel comfortable with an online transaction, I can meet you in the Sellwood area around 2pm.  I can't meet at another place or time, as I feel horrible and will be going home after that.

There was a prompt asking me to call them about it.  I did so, and learned that there have been 3 denied purchases in the last 2 days that were NOT from me. I explained that those weren't my purchases and WF cancelled the card and are sending me a new one. All sketchy purchases were denied, so no harm done to me other than having to wait for the new card.

This kind of thing has NEVER happened to me so I'm a little perturbed and would like to take action against this prick that tried to do this.

Here's the thing. I've had this credit card for like 4 years without incident.  Coincidentally, I've also had the card in my wallet without interruption for those same 4 years EXCEPT for Sunday night through Monday night of this week, just before the fraudulent attempts started.

Monday at work I started thinking about what to eat for lunch and noticed my credit card was missing.  After about 30 seconds of thinking I realized that I must have left it at the bar I was at Sunday night. It was the only place I spent money. So I called the bar from work and spoke to someone I don't know THAT well from the bar and asked them to look for my card.  They had me wait for a minute or two and then came back and told me they didn't see any cards there. Well, that sucked for me but I started coming around to the idea that the card was gone and I would need to cancel it and order a new one.

Monday night after work I decided to just stop by the bar and ask in person to look for my card.  This time I was dealing with the bartender who was actually working Sunday night and he was able to find my card immediately (it was in a locked drawer, it's obviously like company policy to do this to cards left at the bar).

So while this turn of events made me happy Monday, remembering it today after learning about the attempted credit card fraud makes my blood boil. While it boggles me that someone would be so stupid as to copy down a credit card number and then LET THE CARD BE RETURNED TO THE OWNER AND STILL TRY TO USE IT, I can't imagine any other scenarios whereby my card number could get into someone's hands. That, and it's just too much of a coincidence to be by chance, that I see the first ever fraudulent (attempted) charges to my card during the timespan that my card was ""lost"" (at this bar, locked in a drawer).

So, what do you think /r/portland? I called the non-emergency police number to file a report, but they were ""closed"" temporarily when the operator wanted to transfer me to a ""phone operator"" in order to explain it to them. 

Should I go through with the police report even though no fraud actually was successfully completed. Should I talk to employees at the bar? Should I send a letter to its management? Should I put the name of the establishment on blast so others can avoid this? I actually really like the place and it is the closest place to my apartment.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

Here's the official blurb:

Join us for our first ever Events Volunteer Open House Feb. 28th from 6-7:30pm at the Oaks Park Hangar!

If you love the idea of being part of what makes our events amazing, if you want to meet new people, or if you want to hang out with that friend or loved one that joined the league as a skater and they’re always skating now, this is the event for you! Meet current volunteers staffing events, find out about all the moving pieces, and let us know what you think you might like to do.

Areas of events represented will be:

Front Desk Lead – make sure everyone gets tickets and gets in the door. Great role for friendly people who like doing customer service.

Raffle – learn about selling tickets and dressing up all fancy. Raffle is a big part of our annual fundraising and is great for outgoing people who love glitter.

Purple Reign – talk to strangers about roller derby and wear a super cute purple shirt. Don’t know a lot about derby? It’s okay! We train!

Assistant Events Coordinators – great resume booster if you think you’d like to work in events. Learn ALL the in’s and outs. Great candidates will have awesome critical thinking skills and can remain calm under chaos.

Sound Technicians – play will all of our equipment and keep it doing what it needs to do at events.

Merch Sales – be the face behind the merch table. Help sell the swag that promotes the league. Options for league and team merch available.

Medics – if you have a medical background, we would love to talk to you about being a medic! The medic supports an OHSU doctor at all public events to keep skaters and fans safe.

Yellow Shirts – don’t have a lot of time, but want to help out? This is a great option. Come once a year, come every bout, we love you all the same. Tasks include checking wrist bands, getting butts in seats, and helping answer fans’ questions.

I'm currently (1pm 1/28/15) sitting at OHSU with my wife after being referred here by our midwife because we're having twins and the last ultrasound raised some concerns.

2 Weeks Ago: This referral came just under two weeks ago. My wife got the call at work and actually left due to hearing “we need to talk."" She called me and I left to meet her at the house after she told me what specific disease was suspected. It was fairly emotional for me, but my wife didn't know that I cried on my drive home. I eventually went back to work to finish my shift and take my mind off of the issues at hand.

 We were referred here due to the newest technology because after our previous ultrasound, our midwife said that she saw that both babies may have early warning signs for complications (one potentially severe for our little girl and one potentially severe one for our little boy). We just completed our ultrasound here and were introduced to our specialist. Basically, he said that everything ended up being normal and that both babies looked great. We both thanked him. As soon as he left the room, I helped my wife off of the table, hugged my wife, and sobbed into her shoulders for a few minutes. This is the greatest news I've heard in a very long time, and I haven't stopped wiping my eyes since. Thank you, doctor Jorge Tolosa (I believe) for delivering such great news and thank you OHSU for hiring such a respectful doctor/specialist to work with. Thank you, Portland, for providing OHSU with the people and technology to change lives. I've never had this type of appreciation for a doctor or hospital before, but I'm glad that I can say that I can.

TL;DR We were told with almost certainly of at least 2 birth defect for one of our twins. Moments ago, specialist explained that the babies appear to be perfect. Thank you Dr. Jorge Telosa.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,OHSU Doctors: Happy Moment,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2u0auk/ohsu_doctors_happy_moment/,1422483735.0
