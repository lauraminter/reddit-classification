It could already be in the marketplace or could be several weeks before the culprit sells it. Since I built the bike myself it has several unique features listed below

I am not a materialistic person. I am between cities/jobs on this tour so the bike is/was my home for the summer. I am devastated and only in pdx for 2 more days. So far I have listed with pdx police, bike index, and creating searches in craigslist and ebay. Suggestions?

**Details:**
Surly - Long Haul Trucker
- Black 46'' frame
- 26'' wheels (Continental Tour Ride)
- Honey colored Brooks leather saddle (possibly under black seat cover) and matching tan handlebar tape
- Teal cable housing
- Headset has a unique spacer thats a lime green beer bottle opener
- Shimano bar end shifters
- Black front rack (old man mountain) and back rack **the front rack cannot be removed unless they find a new quick release for hub mounting**
- Front and back Planet Bike fenders **with lots of bright yellow reflective stickers**
- The right of the top tube only says ""Trucker"" on it (compared to all/most LHT bc I scratched it off).
27 speed. Large chain ring is black, middle and small are silver.
- Pedals are MKS step-in (flat on one side, clips on the other)
- I had a nameplate on the back fender that said ""Megan"" from Natural Bridge, VA but likely was removed.

Going to be in town next weekend (7/31-8/2). First time in Portland. I'm coming all the way from Atlanta, GA. 


I am going to cash in some Marriott points, and I have these two options:


Courtyard Portland City Center
550 SW Oak Street


Portland Downtown Marriott Waterfront
1401 SW Naito Parkway


Looked around on Google. Things of note:
1) seems to be a bunch of food vendors around the courtyard
2) downtown marriott is near the waterfront and park area 


I want to enjoy the nightlife and unique things Portland has to offer. I also plan to spend most of the day's exploring some of the real nature nearby. So the park on the waterfront doesn't seem like that big of a plus.

/u/yello_echs and I are your organizers here. We are in contact with several pubs for the event.

This thread is to serve as an interest check; this will help us decide which venue is large enough for the crowd, and also show the Pub owners how excited people are for it.

Sponsors are being contacted via twitter. We hope to have goodies for giveaways. If you have any tips on this matter, post them here!


&gt; 
&gt; **What is going on?**

&gt; 
&gt; ***The Event***
&gt; 
&gt; Dota 2 is a competitive strategy game (think team chess with reflexes) watched around the world in a very similar manner to a sporting event. The largest tournament is The International (TI for short). The tournament is held in Seattle, where it fills every seat in Key Arena (30,000 attendees). Even more people watch online for free through the website Twitch.tv. This year's prize pool is over fifteen million dollars. 
&gt; 

&gt; ***The Pubstomps:***
&gt; 
&gt; Pubstomps are events where the community gathers to watch major Dota 2 tournaments at local beer halls or pubs. Valve Software (The people who own Dota 2 and Steam) offers a page to preregister guests for these events at
&gt; www.dota2.com/pubstomps/listings/

&gt; I will handle the community management and registration for this, and the site will keep you posted on expected attendees. Merchandise can also be sent to the bar for raffle prizes with the aid of sponsors.
 
**Hope to see you there!**

I got a DUI very early in the year and had to enter into diversion. I recently completed it(yes, I learned my lesson. big time).  I came on this sub months ago asking about diversion and got no real reply but several PMs from people who were in the same situation and wanted me to let them know what to expect.  So maybe someone in a similar situation some day can search this sub and find this information helpful.

The first thing you will have to do will be attend something called the victim's impact panel.  These happen a few times a month and it's usually in an auditorium setting where you will hear people explain stories about how drunk driving changed their lives.  You'll hear from people who lost children and maybe even people who have been responsible for killing someone while drunk.  It's a one time thing.

Next you go into actual diversion.  I went to Treatment Services NW.  There's several locations in Portland.  The first step is a face to face interview with a counselor to determine the level of treatment you'll need.  After that you enter into something called Phase 1.  In Phase 1 you'll go to six classes where you learn about alcohol and how it affects the body and mind.  These are once a week.  During this time you'll have random UAs.  After your six weeks you'll have another face to face interview to check in and see how you are doing.  Then you will move on to Phase 2.

In Phase 2 it's a little more work.  You have 1-2 weekly homework assignments(easy to do) as well as your weekly class.  Along with this you'll also have to attend AA meetings once a week.  There are 12 classes in phase two, once a week.  So long as you get all of your homework done and show up to class you should pass.  You'll continue to have random UAs during this time. 

After Phase 2 you'll have another face to face meeting with a counselor to determine if you've paid all your fees, been to class on time, passed all your UAs, etc.  If you have done all that you should be discharged from the class.  If your DUI was severe, or it was your second, third, etc. offense.. you will have one final interview where you have to really present a plan detailing how you won't foul up again.

Lastly, if you fail any UAs or you have too many diluted tests, you will be required to double down on how many classes you take.  It will go from once a week to twice a week and you'll have to begin Phase 2 over again.  Oregon state law requires 90 days of sobriey so if you mess up on day 89 you are starting over.  I hope none of y'all end up in this situation, but I'm guessing most who are still reading may be.  But it's really not that bad so long as you take it serious and don't try to be sneaky.  Good luck.

Zachary Nelson, a friend from high school was supposed to be meeting me at Tabor Tavern on Friday night, where he was waiting for me to get home, so he could crash on my couch for a night. He had just arrived in Portland with friends, was hoping to find a job as a cook in town. Unfortunately, he never showed up at Tabor Tavern or The Tannery (where i also looked just in case). I waited up for him to show up, and finally went to bed. Contacted him via facebook the next day and never heard anything back. Last night I found out that his friend with whom he'd come to Portland hadn't heard from him at all, either. So, we're filing a missing person report and we'd like to have everyone keep an eye out for him, please.
According to his friend: He went to Portland to get a job as a cook in most likely a strip club. He was last with me Friday night at around 9:45 pm in front of Dante's on burnside, he was headed to a bar called tabor tavern to kill time until he met up with Jennifer (me).

He was travelling with no belongings. He is not in jail or the hospital (we checked). Above photo is what he was wearing on Friday; he also had a purple psychadelic-print jacket.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,default,MISSING PERSON - HELP!,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3e3afa/missing_person_help/,1437498379.0,,

I really can't afford to move to a new place unless it's an emergency, so moving really isn't an option. 

About a year and a half ago I got new downstairs neighbors; English isn't their first language, they don't really talk to much of anyone in our building, and I rarely see them. But I hear them. A LOT. They have two kids, one toddler and one in early elementary school, and they're REALLY REALLY LOUD. Like they run everywhere, and jump off furniture, and slam doors, and throw things, and god knows what else. I know every single time the toddler has a screaming tantrum because I can hear it. I can hear the dad yelling at them, too, quite frequently. And it happens throughout the day almost every day. For a while I was keeping detailed records of the noise, and there were days when out of a twelve hour day, over six hours were full of noise. I mean, I'd expect this amount of noise if they lived above me--but they live below me.

I've tried asking them to keep it down, which only works for a day or three, then they're back to it. I've complained to the landlord twice; he sent letters each time, but after the second one insinuated that his higher-ups wouldn't let him send more because children are apparently a ""protected class"". I know that that qualifies when you're trying to rent a place, but does it also mean that kids are exempt from noise restrictions in the lease?

They quieted down relatively for a few months, but the noise has been ramping up again over the past couple of weeks and it's about to drive me nuts. Should I start keeping records again and make another complaint? Or are these people legally allowed to let their kids be as loud and obnoxious as they like, just because they're kids? Should I not complain again for fear of the management company kicking me out as the proverbial squeaky wheel?

(P.S. Please don't suggest things like ""put your stereo speakers on the floor and blast polka music"". I don't want them to be able to file legitimate noise complaints about me, and I already feel bad about the noise they have to hear with me walking around on old creaky floors above them.)",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,"Downstairs neighbors' kids are REALLY loud.
