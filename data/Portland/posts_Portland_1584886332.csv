If you're isolating yourselves at home, and then you have to go out shopping, there's a bit of an issue with the isolation; plus, all the workers who are put at risk because of all the people in the grocery stores.

Here's my thought with regards to this problem. There are ~250k households in the Portland area. Assuming that each household gets groceries once per week, that is 35k deliveries of groceries to be made. Now, let's assume (because atm I don't have the numbers) that there are 500 grocery stores in the Portland Area. That would mean there would need to be 70 pickups per grocery store, per day.

* 250k homes
* 500 grocery stores
* 35k grocery deliveries per day / 7 days week
* 70 pick ups per grocery store.

So my idea is this: If every grocery store got on board, their employees would only need to shop for items and package them in boxes. Volunteer drivers would then pick up these orders and drop them at the people's front doors. With the right coordination, this could be coordinated in such a way that each grocery store in the area gets N number of pickups per day, and can essentially shut themselves off from the public. This also handles the issue with people hoarding.

As well, it would be nice to go along with this something to allow people who are more fortunate to donate to those who are less fortunate, so that nobody is going without food.

This is just a rough idea. There'd need to be a lot of coordination here, but I was curious to see if anyone had any thoughts.",True,False,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,149140,public,self,An idea regarding grocery shopping.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/fn03tg/an_idea_regarding_grocery_shopping/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WARRENTON GIVES TOURISTS 24 HOURS TO GET OUT OF TOWN

By Cindy Yingst
The Columbia Press
Tourists have 24 hours to get out of town or face arrest.
Warrenton city commissioners took the stance after thousands of people from elsewhere arrived in town Friday and Saturday, clogging highways 30, 26 and 101.
Warrenton called an emergency meeting at 5 p.m. Saturday, first issuing a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 outbreak and then taking further action to prevent those from other areas coming here on vacations and spring break or for simple recreation and endangering residents.
“This is a serious event and it’s also a major event,” Mayor Henry Balensifer said earlier in the day during a livestream broadcast. “Our top priority is doing what we need to do for the best interest of our citizens.”
Resolution 2565, “To ensure the public health and safety of the citizens of Warrenton and to avoid unnecessary risks to hospital surge in Clatsop County,” makes the following orders:
All camping is closed at Warrenton and Hammond marinas.
All camping is closed at KOA, Fort Stevens State Park, Kampers West and Hammond Marina RV Park. An exception is made for permanent residents, camp hosts, employees and anyone living as a long-term resident of the facilities who were residents with contracts before March 11 – when the virus was declared a pandemic.
All stays in short-term rentals, home-stay lodging and B&amp;Bs are prohibited.
All hotels within city limits are closed except for current users registered for longer than 30 days and as authorized by the county, state or federal health authorities. So long-term contractors already staying in the city’s hotels may remain.
All camping on private property, except by order of the police chief or state, is prohibited.
The resolution takes effect immediately and those affected have 24 hours to vacate.
The vote was unanimous with Balensifer, Tom Dyer, Rick Newton and Mark Baldwin at City Hall – separated by 6 feet – and Pam Ackley via telephone.
The resolution will be enforced by Warrenton Police and four officers were at City Hall for the Saturday meeting, including Chief Matt Workman. 
“We’re prepared for that,” Workman told commissioners. “I’ve spoken with Sheriff Phillips and he will provide us with any additional resources as needed.”
The offense – remaining in town after the 24 hours – is a class C misdemeanor “and that is an arrestable offense,” he said.
“I would hope that the majority of the folks that are affected by this order … will cooperatively work with the city so as not to tax the limited resources we have,” City Manager Linda Engbretson said.
Officers will contact managers of the campgrounds and hotels and they’re expected to take action to clear out their facilities.
Balensifer said he’d spoken with county officials, County Commissioner Mark Kujala and state Senator Betsy Johnson and all are aware of the city’s action and support it.

## For Shoppers
1. SOCIAL DISTANCE! Stay 6 feet away from other people. That means taking a detour for narrow spaces or waiting for someone to be done choosing an item before going in for yours.        
2. Go alone if you can. If you have a significant other or roommate then make a list and send ONE person only. Shoppers in groups makes it difficult to social distance even if you go with people who you are already in close contact with.        
3. Couples with kids, see 1. No need to bring you, your spouse and your 2.3 kids to make it difficult for others to go around. Kids are also unpredictable and may be harder to avoid. Make a list, send only one, and take turns watching kids if possible.       
4. Don't grab an item and put it back. Try to make sure you really want an item before touching it.      
5. Don't put your cart on one side of the aisle and stand on the other looking for things, how can we go by and give you 6 feet?      
6. Try to get as much as you can to limit store trips.      
7. Carry a sanitizer wipe or paper towel with sanitizer on it and use it to wipe cart handles and open freezer doors. This may be a bit overboard for some people, but I believe in it and do it.

## For Stores      
1. Thank you for putting up with us during these trying times!!
2. Many grocery stores are doing AMAZING things, sanitizing cart handles on every return as well as the credit/debit card machine. If your store doesn't do this, please do!
3. Remove all of the stands in aisles with promotional items and other unnecessary bottlenecks. These make it difficult to social distance in aisles. Also, these items are usually on a shelf already somewhere else.

I am not perfect, I have been guilty of a few of these and try to check myself, but let's all please try. Remember that this effects EVERYONE. The better we do now, the sooner we can go back to some kind of normal.

One of the upsides to being stuck in the house for the last week and a half, is that it's given me the chance to set up a live streaming rig in the living room.

So tonight at 8, we're going to stream a live set from Will of Window Business.  If you're like us and hanging out at home this evening and would like to catch some local Portland music, do drop by for a few!

When they announced that they were putting these out before the pre-order I was talking with my friend about how I wanted to buy one just because I wanted the controllers but I couldn't justify buying a new Switch, he put the idea in my head that if I bought one he'd buy my old one from me. 

Well... pre-orders came out and I forgot. And when I remembered, they were closed. And when they came out I told my friend ""I'll find one around someplace like Freds"" and I haven't. Ultimately not a big deal.

However, with all the COVID-19 stuff going around I kinda wanna just ""give"" my friend my Switch since he was part of the massive layoffs in the last few days. Also because most will be going into shelter-in-place and my work will be deemed ""essential,"" but I also still want to play Animal Crossing myself. So I'm hoping before everything shuts down I can find one so I can give my friend something to do while being on lockdown.

Anyone see one in town? Preferably something in biking distance, willing to bike out to Troutdale or Gresham areas too.
