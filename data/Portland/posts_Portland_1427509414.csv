I had five cars in front of me, going about 27 mhp and once I figured out what the bright flashes were, I slowed down. By the time I was roughly 70 feet from the vehicle my speed was no more than 23 mph, UNDER the speed limit of 25 mph, but my photo was still taken. While driving back I passed three cars that also approached the speed trap and got photographed. There were a couple dudes hanging out by the trap, clearly not cops (smoking, skateboards, pocket chains), but I think they were noticing that it was taking way too many pictures as well. What's my next step? Do I call traffic control? Wait for my photo to arrive in the mail before I contest it? Should I even bother? I really don't want to pay a ticket when I was not speeding. I got a ticket in another state for speeding a couple years ago and now I'm super paranoid about how fast I go, constantly checking my speedometer. Thanks!

I need ideas how to get this *fucker* back. 

Back story:  A couple days ago, the across the street neighbor started some construction on his driveway. It appears he is widening it. Whatever, no biggie. So on the second day of jack hammering, I noticed this shitty fake tree laying in our yard. It was right in front of where the workers had been parking. I assumed it was just some of the bushes/trees they had removed and it would be hauled away. But when the day was over, there it was. ""They'll take it tomorrow"" I thought. Yesterday, the tree is still there. The work was almost done, and I didn't get a chance to ask them if they were taking it. So I put it in the owners truck last night. *I may have been drinking*. His truck is always parked in front of our house. This afternoon, low and behold, it's in our front yard again. So I waited until he got home, and walked out and asked him, ""Is this your tree?"" Blank stare, ""No. Someone put it in my truck."" ""Yeah, that was me. This tree magically showed up in our yard the day you started construction."" ""No, no. That's not my tree. I only pulled out live trees from my yard."" ""Uh huh. Ok, well I guess I'll ask the workers tomorrow.""  Shortly after this, I saw him sneak across the street, and kind of debate dragging it into his garage. But he didn't.
