My argument is that despite a priest officiating the wedding you are not legally married until you sign the papers for the state; meaning the priest doesn't really have any real power to marry people because it only matters in paper. 

My friend thinks that even if the couple doesn't sign any marriage license that they are still legally married and would have to file for divorce the same way if they didn't sign papers. 

Does anyone have any experience or insight in this matter? I mean you can have a priest take a course to legally marry you as a Jedi; the state only recognizes a marriage if they sign the papers, right?

We had to move from our old place because the owner decided she wanted to sell. We ended up staying with our current property management company, [Performance Property](http://ppirentals.com) because we **thought** we knew what we were dealing with. We were wrong.  
  
The company has an exhaustive list of cleaning requirements for it's tenants to follow when they move out. For the house we vacated we hired a house cleaning company as well as a professional carpet cleaner, which they require. We swept and mopped and washed the windows, which they require. We even pulled the light-switch covers and cleaned behind them, which they require. We figured these same standards would be applied to the new place. Guess again.  
  
We've taken literally hundreds of photos of the deplorable and disgusting condition of the house we moved in to. Urine on the floor around the toilet, spit on the front door, literally years worth of grime on the kitchen floor. And then there's the treasure trove of hot wheels and dog hair we found under the stove (another place that's supposed to be cleaned before moving out.) We contacted our 'region manager' at the company, who insisted that the place was clean, but if we wanted to submit a complaint he'd 'put it in our file'. We even had maintenance send a guy out to fix the windows that the painting crew had painted shut, and when he called his boss (I eavesdropped on the call through the living room window) I could hear him getting chewed out for worrying about anything other than maintenance.  
  
My wife is recovering from breast cancer, and I'm supposed to be on a flight to Albuquerque tomorrow to finish a job in the Apache-Sitgrieves NF. Instead, I'm on Craigslist and Hotpads, and here on Reddit. We're looking for a 1-year rental for 2 adults, 1 sullen teen-ager, and a cat. We're moving to Santa Fe next year, we just want to get our daughter through high-school. If it weren't for her, we'd move now, but we feel it's more important for her to finish high school where she started; it wouldn't be fair to move to another state right now. I know it's a crazy long shot, but what the hell. If anyone knows of a place I'd love to hear about it. Thanks.

She is microchipped.

Tikka is a lab/ Rottweiler mix, black with classic Rottweiler markings, small build, about 65lbs. She's a little round (maybe a bit chubby), and has a crooked tail that only wags to one side (awwwww!).

This dog means so much to my bro. He found her on the side of the road as a starving puppy about 8 years ago, nursed her back to health, and gave her a happy home. She has never run away before and she's quite timid. 

Please keep an eye out for her. It would mean the world to have her back safe and sound. **If you have any information, please message me here, or contact my brother, Hunter, at xm_pdx@yahoo.com or 503-730-3030.** (He asked me to include his contact info, but if that's against the rules, I'll remove it).

$1,000 reward for the return of Tikka.

Hey everyone, 

My friends and I put this together after we managed to get some free pizza. We could have easily found a way for us to eat it all ourselves but we felt it was worth our time to hand it out to the homeless. We aren't sponsored by Domino's, MLB or anything, and I don't visit /r/randomactsofpizza often, but we just wanted to do something nice with what we had. Nobody should have to feel hungry, and even just pizza can really help. Besides, everyone loves pizza. 

We had 10 pizzas, which had roughly 10 slices per box. Knowing that, we made it our mission to hand out a slice to every single homeless person we saw. A slice might not seem like much, and many people asked if they could have a whole box, but we felt it was important to reach as many people as possible so that's what we did. We gave out 1 slice to every person we saw that seemed to be living on the streets that night, which came out to 100 people give or take a few. 

So that's it. I hope you guys enjoy the video. We had a lot of fun doing it. Everyone was really happy to get a slice and all it took was a couple hours of our time to walk around and find people who need an extra push to keep going. 

With that said, I don't have anymore free pizzas, but if you or someone you know is hungry, I have coupons for 50% off any menu priced item at dominos.com that expire by Friday at 12pm (pst). Again, we aren't sponsored or work for dominos, but I have these to give out. You don't have to give them out to the homeless. I hope you enjoy the pizza and maybe if you have the opportunity, you can be kind and give pizza.

What did you think?

For me: If you follow him in any capacity (interviews, articles, etc) some of the show is going to be overlap. He's been talking about eating hog's ass - followed by a slew of antibiotics, and ""the grandma rule"" for, what, 10 years now?

There's were a lot of standard lines and canned rerun rants. A lot of trashing on the Food Network (still?). 

I was a little put off toward the end when someone asked him why he was doing the tour.  He was very quick to answer, ""Well, it's lucrative."" ""Also, I like Portland"" came shortly after but felt a bit like a backpedal statement. That all said, I'm pretty sure he was at least slightly drunk from the moment he stepped on stage. 

Overall it was a good show/glimpse into his thoughts but I'm not sure I need to see him speak live again.

The membership gives you access to the general exhibits/museum for free for a year for the one adult and up to four kids. It also has cross benefits against 250 other museums internationally (You can see the membership information [here](https://www.omsi.edu/membership), under Family, except it would be for 1 adult since I have to be named as the 2nd adult). If you or someone you know would be interested, please message me. Again, I would prefer to offer it to someone who would not normally be financially able to go or someone who supports kids who are not able to go (since the names of the kids do not have to be specified).

I would need to know your name and address to put on the card. Please don't send this information to me unless I've specifically indicated that you'll be the person on the card. Instead, just let me know why you would benefit from it.
