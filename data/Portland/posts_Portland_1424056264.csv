I'm thinking about getting a scooter, but I have some questions. Specifically, my commute is currently from SE Portland to Beaverton near Washington Square Mall. Is there a route that a scooter can go between here and there? I think they are capped at like 45 mph right?

Second, what about Winter? I mean, right now it's moderate, but it does get rainy here. I was hoping to get rid of my car, but I'm not sure about using a scooter during the Winter. Anyone have any experience?

It might just be that a scooter isn't going to work for me right now because of my commute, but I wanted to hear other people's experience.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Scooter Travel in Portland (and Beaverton),http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2w19a9/scooter_travel_in_portland_and_beaverton/,,,

So here goes. We were best friends during junior high (1982, before Oregon had middle school) and we both lived in the Beaverton area. She was more Highland and I was more Whitford, but we walked back and forth to each others house, Scholls to Denney, pretty much constantly. We LOVED Men at Work. Went to their concert here in 1982.

We grew up, went through high school in different places, then suddenly she had a kid. It was surprising, frankly, because she was a big girl. I am too, but she really was. I didn't know back then that fat girls could get attention from men. But she did, and then, she disappeared.

I was told she gave her baby up, then a few years later I heard she was pregnant again. I went to see her that time. I'd tried before but she'd put me off. I went to a place out on Milwaukie, and there was a baby in a crib, and she was stoned out of her mind. I am experienced enough now to know it was heroin.

Her mom took the baby, and some beaverton paper even did a story about them. Grandmothers raising kids.

I ran into her once on the streets. She was sitting on a corner like a fat buddha, hoping for change. I stopped and recollected her to our lives together way back when, and she really, really did not want me to do that. So I left her alone.

I never saw her again. I guess since I saw her family expand via the paper, I thought maybe I'd see her resolution later. I guess not. Just asking in case reddit knows her.

* Get volunteers

I've been here about 7 months and they tasked me with finding a good restaurant to do the wedding reception. It won't be a terribly big reception, less than 30 people for sure. They enjoy eating and want good, quality food. Budget isn't too much of a worry, though it can't be something too high-end.

Do you guys have any suggestions for good Portland restaurants that would be able to handle a small wedding reception? Only rule is: No Italian.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,default,Friends Coming In To Do Wedding,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2vvovz/friends_coming_in_to_do_wedding/,,,

They have shown me how much they care about single fathers. My son has been living with me full time for over a year now. I filed for child support in January of 2014. They have yet to finalize that judgment. In the mean time, they have continued to send me notices of support owed by me to my ex. I've called and spoken to my case worker who said not to worry that the state will no longer be seeking payment. Well guess what, they have. Took all of my tax refund state and federal. Now I have to fight to get it back. I have also called to find out the status of my case. Every time I get told it's in process and that they have a backlog and not enough case workers. That just sounds like bullshit to me. My ex was able to get a support order changed in a mater of weeks when she felt she wasn't getting enough out of me. But now that the shoe is on the other foot, I feel Like I'm not being treated fairly. I don't know what else to do at this point.
