My last heating bill was kinda absurd. I'd like to improve energy efficiency, for both environmental and financial reasons. I'm trying to educate myself on insulation and whatnot, but I'm not really sure where to start. 

My house is mostly uninsulated, single-pane windows are drafty when the wind blows, visible gaps under some doors...so, there are lots of improvement targets. But I'm not sure how to identify the 'low hanging fruit' that would be the biggest return on investment. For example, does it make more sense to just get the attic insulated first, or should I bite the bullet and get storm windows? If so, does anybody have advice on finding reasonably priced storm windows?

I have lots of questions, but most of the online resources I find are either for new houses, or are basically ads for insulation companies. I remember years ago in town hearing about 'free energy audits' that I think were funded by state money. I've tried googling for something like that, but I keep just finding private companies that basically want to sell me their services. 

Ideally, I'd love to have an experienced person take a look at my house and identify the best, cheapest solutions for improving efficiency. Is there anything like a private, home inspector who does energy audits? I'm fairly handy and willing to do installation work if that's feasible, so I'd rather not get involved with a private company unless I need to go that route.  

I appreciate any suggestions for local resources, or good online information sources.

This would be a replacement to the one that is in my basement, so that I can remove all the ducts and move the wiring/plumbing to go through the floor joists and get more ceiling height / finish the ceiling.

Few questions:

1) I've seen furnaces installed on platforms with blocks raising them up and suspended from metal straps (or threaded rod/unistruct).  Is one type required in Portland to pass inspection? I've heard that suspending them makes them quieter.  Is that true as well?

2) Any other things I should especially be careful about to get through inspection? (E.g. Distances from combustibles, etc)

3) Can anyone recommend a good local company to buy ducts, registers, dampers, and plenums?

If people could stick to my questions and avoid telling me that I need to get a professional I'd appreciate it.  I've already done the load calculations, CFM requirements for each room, duct size calculations, planned the venting, gas line, drip-pan/drain, and electrical is already done.

I kept walking without reaction as if I were deaf. Didn't even look back to see if they had a weapon. There were not many people around, but my ignorance seemed to work out. I walked away a little bit faster, but didn't look back...

Nothing against white people (I'm half white). I have plenty of white friends/acquaintances

BUT

I'm from Chicago and used to being around a lot more black people and honestly I miss having black friends :( 

So does anyone know good places to find diverse crowds? I like hiphop music but am open to whatever. I know Church bar tends to get pretty diverse on weekends but the music is usually top 40 and so loud I can't discern my own voice.
