We rescued her from a shelter in California in March and it has been a challenge. She is a wonderful dog in many ways but she has anxiety and bite inhibition issues. She bit my toddler and despite all we have invested in her she needs to find a new home. 

We have tried Pixie Project, Family Dogs New Life and the Humane Society but none will accept her due to her bite history. I called the county shelter and in short they made it clear that her best chance is if we rehome her ourselves. 

She is a friendly, cuddly, cute as hell dog that deserves a good home. She needs a home without children or cats. She would be best suited as the only pet due to her needs but she is currently living with another very tolerant dog. She needs an owner who has experience with high needs dogs.

She is a 1.5 yr old basset/other hound mix. She is long and tall and lean at 45lbs. She has a cute basset face and ears but on the body of a runner. She loves fetch and cuddles. She needs to be somebody's baby. 

For more information please read my post history if at all interested or if you know someone who is, or an organization who might be willing to take her on please PM me. We are running out of options and if we can't find anyone we will have to euthanize her.

My post(s) last year resulted in a whole lot of kits being made, and I have a feeling now that everyone is freaking out about that [terrifying New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one), there will be some fresh interest. 

[Here is the post from last summer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2eo2nr/i_am_an_emergency_services_volunteer_and_id_like/). These are the details:

My name is Dajah and I am a disaster services volunteer for the Red Cross, and a part of the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management’s NET (neighborhood emergency team). Preparedness is my passion, and I started a project last summer to help my community get its shit together.

All of the information about this project is available here:

[http://pdxprepared.tumblr.com/] (http://pdxprepared.tumblr.com/)

[http://www.facebook.com/BuildMeAKit] (http://www.facebook.com/BuildMeAKit)

My premise is simple: You give me your budget, I make you an emergency kit. $40? $400? We can do it. I am donating my time so every one of your dollars goes directly to emergency supplies. I will even deliver it to your house. 

This is an independent project. I’ve got the support of the Red Cross Preparedness department (they’ve hooked up SO MUCH stuff- I got 20 boxes of Safety Tubes from them last month!) and PBEM’s volunteer coordinator is helping me out as well (picking up stuff from him this week!). 

Since this is not their personal operation they have kindly (and understandably) asked that I not post scanned copies of my badges. However, in the interest showing I am indeed one of their volunteers, I can hold up my badges to people and say “I did a bunch of emergency response training! Isn’t that cool!” So, [“I did a bunch of emergency response training! Isn’t that cool?”]( https://www.flickr.com/photos/spitfirehussy/15036097975/)

My goal is to bridge the motivation gap, as well as provide information about emergency preparedness. I feel that there is an outreach gap between emergency services and the entire 20-40 year old demographic, and I want to do what I can to change that. 

Anybody is capable of assembling a kit, but my experience is that most people don’t have the motivation/time to do it. I am volunteering to do all the legwork. It’s that simple.

Kits usually take 2-3 weeks to get done, because I process them in batches. Doing several orders at a time means pooling resources, which means buying in bulk for cheap on the internet. Everyone gets more for their money, and different people can prioritize different quantities of supplies. 

I aways like to hear suggestions on things to change or add to the kits themselves. I know there’s some smartypants experts around here.  Comparing lists with others is a great way to get the best stuff to the most people. 

Questions? I have an email address.

My husband happened upon it on his way to work and called to warn me not to drive that way because there was a very gruesome wreck where a car had pulled out in front of a bike and the bike slammed into it.  He stopped where several other people had already stopped to see if there was any way he could help and was told there was nothing anyone could do to help, that the cyclist was dead.

I know a lot of people who ride around here so I checked the news -- nothing.  There still isn't any news about it.

Was someone filming something there or was it real?  It seems so strange; he believes it was real but I never heard any sirens or anything.

He's pretty freaked out about it so I'm just wondering if anyone knows what happened.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,What happened at 45th and Harney this morning about 7 AM?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3dbizp/what_happened_at_45th_and_harney_this_morning/,,,,,,,

I know from experience that ticks live in tall grass waiting for an animal to come along so they can hitch a ride, so I stay out of tall grass, but this was sitting at a table and twice I caught these little creepy crawlers on me.

We did have success a couple weeks after launch and have been unsuccessful since then. 

A little about us - we are a small clan of mostly working dads that play 3-4 hours a day on weeknights and weekends. We are fairly casual but have been clearing HM Crota / VOG for a very long time without any problems.

This week was particularly brutal - on Sunday we started at 9 PM and wiped a few times before even getting to the Skolas round. Once on the Skolas round, we could not pass the ""dismantle the mines"" section. We were running with two bubble titans and a self-rez warlock (me). We implemented the same strategy that we had used in the past but found it to be far too chaotic with lighswitch. To make it worse, the mines would spawn at opposite ends of the map from each other and we would run out of time to get to them. We did not separate due to not wanting to die to adds. 

We spent until 1 AM and gave up.
We tried again last night and got to Skolas after about an hour of work and then again failed over and over again, dropping him to 25% on our best effort only to be plagued by the stupid mines spawning across the map again. 

I absolutely feel like 35 POE is not worth the effort unless there are checkpoints OR reputation rewards between rounds to get us to go back through each try. Right now our whole group is very demoralized and many folks have stopped logging on due to the lack of checkpoints and/or rewards.

TLDR: The penalty for not downing Skolas is too great without checkpoints or rep rewards to be able to try again the next day.

The current trend of diminishing representation of women and most minorities in computer science careers is disturbing, and the few people enter the field out of curiosity or aesthetics of elegance. That's a shame.

This is not an undeveloped space with code schools and academies springing up everywhere. I can't comment on the experience of graduates from these programs, and they might be exactly what people are looking for. Yet I have my doubts; the FAQ on one site told me they didn't teach theory, like data structures, at all.

I'd like to teach a community class on programming in a LISP like language called Racket. UC Berkeley has open sourced their materials for this course, and I'd volunteer my time or request a nominal fee to cover costs (perhaps a meeting room at a coffee shop) to teach the fundamentals of computer science. This class would focus on what's happening when programming in any language versus the templating engine for the latest web framework. A capstone could include a fully functioning website as part of a portfolio in a programming language of the student's choice.

Feedback appreciated.

Thanks for reading this installment of [Travel Tuesdays](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3ATravel%2BTuesday).  Last time, /u/warm_sweater was nice enough to take over for me and did a pretty great write up of [Astoria](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3bn92s/travel_tuesdays_astoria_and_the_long_beach/) as I was exploring the [culture of South Dakota](https://i.imgur.com/xwj1uXi.jpg).  And Iowa.  And Ohio.  My favorite part was Greenfield, Indiana.  I was walking to the brewery (2.4 miles from the hotel), but apparently no one walks in Indiana so a semi truck pulled over and gave me a lift.  I'm 40 years old and that was my first time in a semi.  I'm pretty stoked about that.  Especially since I didn't even have to give the driver a handy.

Today I'm going to share a little road trip that I feel is 100% necessary to do if you want to call yourself an Oregonian:  The Willamette River Ferry Hat Trick.  And since it's summer (and therefore berry season), I'm calling this one ""Berries and Ferries.""  Get it?  Because berries rhymes with ferries.  Do you get it?  Rhymes.  

**tl:dr in advance**  There are three ferries that cross the Willamette River (Canby, Wheatland, and Buena Vista) and it is imperative that you cross all three of them at some point in your life.  The following is just a suggested itinerary and a loose interpretation of how I spent my weekend.  I *highly* suggest that you just look at a map, find the ferries, and discover your own fun on the way.   

Okay.  

Start your day at the north (west) end of the [Canby Ferry](http://www.clackamas.us/roads/ferry.html).  For just [four bucks](http://imgur.com/QEBYH1Q) this magical piece of 19th century technology will get you from one side of the river to the other in about five minutes unless there's a line (I've never seen a line).  And sure, at the end of the day it's probably just a boring ferry.  But you never know if somehow, someway, my ex-girlfriend Heather might just leave her car in reverse and drive her Ford Aspire right into the river again.  If that doesn't happen, just take a deep breath, realize you're outside of the UGB, [take a bad picture](http://imgur.com/x2w7AJS) [or two](http://imgur.com/P90ekK3), and relax.   

Almost immediately after getting off the ferry, you'll see [Molalla River State Park](http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=78) off to your right.  It has a few short trails and there are some nice spots to swim in the river if it's a weekday, but the motor boats are mayhem here on weekends.  So if it's hot and you're looking for a nice swimming hole, continue down the road to [Knight's Bridge Park](http://www.outdoorproject.com/adventures/swimming-holes-cliff-jumping/knights-bridge-park).  We used to jump off the old bridge into the Molalla here, but it's since been torn down and replaced with a higher, non-jumpable bridge.  [Saturday was crowded](http://imgur.com/ipbOEDd), but sometimes you luck out here and get the whole place to yourself.   

If you're looking to bring home a gift or would like to take a picture for /r/portland that *isn't* Mt. Hood, be sure to check out [Swan Island Dahlias](http://www.dahlias.com/).  It's a huge farm with every color of dahlia you can imagine, and they even have a whole [dahlia festival](http://www.dahlias.com/annualdahliafestival.aspx) at the end of August.  I also like to stop at the Canby [Bricks and Minifigs](http://bricksandminifigs.com/canby/) because I have a child and sometimes the bulk bins are half price and I can bring home half a metric fuck-ton of Lego home for like twelve dollars.   

After that, it's pretty much berry time.  If you head in almost any general direction from Canby, you won't be able to *not* find a [good U-Pick berry place](http://imgur.com/b2QP3hK).  They're everywhere, but I'm kinda partial to [Morning Shade Farm](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Morning-Shade-Farm/116391798395040).  And with the weird summer weather we're having, the sooner you hit up one of these places the better.  At Morning Shade over the weekend, there were gooseberries, marionberries, boysenberries, raspberries, and [every kind of blueberry ever](http://imgur.com/a/u8LiB).  Berries here are $1.60/lb.  Pretty sure you can get an 8oz thing of blueberries at New Seasons for $4-$5, so you do the math.  My kid and I picked [just over 3 pounds](http://imgur.com/wmXqKlD) of Olympias and Toros for under $5.  By the way, U-Pick farms are a pretty awesome third date--*except strawberries.*  A lot of people say they wouldn't be tempted to play a little strawberry basketball when their date is squatting down picking berries with their coin-slot showing, but a lot of people are liars.  DO NOT pick strawberries unless you *really* know a person.   

By the time you've got your berries safely stashed in your cooler (bring a cooler!), and after stopping at Whiskey Hill for some [baby beer](http://imgur.com/ekJznn1) (don't ask), it should be about time for lunch at [Luis's Taqueria](http://luisstaqueria.com/) in Woodburn.  Flame away, but Luis's has the best Mexican food in the state--possibly the best Mexican food in the world.  [Each plate](http://imgur.com/mV6dWR2) comes with generous portions of radishes and limes, which is fine for amateurs.  But!  Look closely at that picture.  You see the condiment bottle with the green stuff in it?  That unnamed condiment is pure goddess quim.  It's basically avocado and green chili puree, but it's **amazing**.  Slather that nectar over [every bite](http://imgur.com/dGm2ELd) and taste heaven.  And I know I've encouraged people to steal this condiment in the past, but don't.  My wife came up with a really close approximation and I can forward you the recipe if you really like it.   

After you're done eating be sure to stagger across the street before leaving town to [Palacio Del Vestir](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-palacio-del-vestir-woodburn) for pointy-toed cowboy boots, a grand selection of [awesome hats](http://imgur.com/XIAN5rL), or [this dress](http://imgur.com/izClxrk), in case you are expecting a baby girl to be born late next week.  Downtown Woodburn is a pretty damn adventurous 4th date, by the way.   It's okay if you didn't bring a date, however, because you can always stop at the [Saint Louis Fish Ponds](http://imgur.com/qT7SBff) instead.  They stock this pond so much it's not even a challenge.  I like bringing kids here because they are pretty much guaranteed to catch trout here.  Use Powerbait for the little fish, and worms if you want something bigger.  You'll catch your limit before you open a second beer.   

So here's a secret trick about the [Wheatland Ferry](http://www.co.marion.or.us/PW/ferries/wheatland.htm):  If you approach the ferry from the east and park on Matheny Road just before you get to the ferry, you can walk into [WIllamette Mission State Park](http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=99).  About a mile in, there's a [hiker-biker camp](https://i.imgur.com/U5XgF6t.jpg) that no one uses complete with flush bathrooms, water, picnic tables, and fire rings.  The best part:  Park closes at 9pm so you get the entire park to yourself after that.  I'm not sure if you've ever attached 55 glow sticks to your bicycle and body for an epic moonlight ride around a former Methodist Mission, but if you haven't, it makes for a good 5th date.  Just follow [this trail](http://imgur.com/ZAZ9mB8) for about a mile and follow the signs to the campground.  The ranger will come by around closing and charge you $5 per tent and he or she will even sell you a bundle of firewood if you want.   As a bonus, you can now say you've gone backpacking.  Technically.  

Jump onto the [ferry](http://imgur.com/TYEAxpk) here and enjoy the [pace](https://youtu.be/tAl29EvmfLY).  For some reason the sound of the ferry is like a nice woolly blanket to me.  I'm like a porn star sitting on a washing machine when I'm on a ferry.  Take an immediate right as soon as you get off and you'll hit [Arcane Cellars](http://www.arcanecellars.com/).  It's $10 for a taster flight, but even if you don't like wine I gotta say this one is worth it.  There's a lovely [outdoor space](http://imgur.com/kahevXU) for a picnic, you can play some [bocce ball](http://imgur.com/YLvyrSU), or you can explore the [trail](http://imgur.com/hB7qKM1) leading down to the river.  ALSO, if you ever on a multi-day kayaking trip, the owner will let you camp on the property.  Look for that in an upcoming Travel Tuesday, for sure.  If someone tells you that you can camp in their winery, you don't simply say no.  

Two ferries down, one to go.  I know this is a long one, but bear with me here--we're in the home stretch.  Next stop is the [Willamette Valley Cheese Company](http://www.wvcheeseco.com/).  I'm not sure what I can tell you at this point.  Basically, you go in, you fill out [this form](http://imgur.com/ImagoDj), and you snack on 20 different kinds of cheese.  I mean, what?  Do I have to draw you a diagram here?  It's free cheese!  Buy some [havarti](http://imgur.com/EDh5UWs) to throw in your cooler with the blueberries.  Don't put the cheese in the same cooler as your trout (bring two coolers!).  After you're full of samples, don't leave before saying hi to [Sharlene](http://imgur.com/wGAECGm).  She's the Guernsey that likes to [lick](http://imgur.com/kyC1Tzk) iPhones.   Total 6th date material.  

From there, snake your way around West Salem, down through Independence (this town desperately needs a brewery, by the way), and hang a left on Buena Vista Road.  Now, I know we all hate Rogue beer, and for good reason.  But [Rogue Farms](http://www.rogue.com/roguefarms/?age-verified=2615609303) is an interesting spot to stop if you have time.  It's basically a working [farm](http://imgur.com/1nH1xMl) with an expansive outdoor seating area.  And four sets of cornhole.  I really want to change the name of that game to ""bean bag toss.""  The clientele here is 100% young families with small children.  It was weird, but I got my [taster tray](http://imgur.com/2VhIGsN) so it was fine.  I didn't bother taking the farm tour as it was getting late in the day, but I'm hoping they let all the toddlers there ride the pigs.  Maybe have races with some sort of bracket system?  I don't know.  

From Rogue, you're not far from completing the hat trick by crossing the [Buena Vista Ferry](http://www.co.marion.or.us/PW/ferries/buenaferryfees.htm).  The [smallest](http://imgur.com/VzaZtmd) of the three ferries, Buena Vista might surprise you since there are [small rapids](http://imgur.com/Mu9sa8L) just a few feet from the ferry line as the Willamette snakes around [Wells Island](http://willamettewatertrail.org/map/wells-island/).  Polk County runs a [nice park and boat ramp](http://www.co.polk.or.us/ms/buena-vista-park) on the west side of the river here, and overnight parking is allowed.  So if you brought a canoe, Wells Island is a great place to camp on a 7th date.  Especially if you split a pot brownie and decide to walk around on the island naked all day.  That can really take your mind off a submerged Ford Aspire, I've found.  There's a nice little beach on the backchannel side, and an actual camping area on the northern tip of the island.   

Upon [crossing](http://youtu.be/VYyQ0rK4wAs) this third ferry, congratulations are in order.  I don't know the percentage of Oregonians that have crossed all three ferries, but I imagine it's less than 1%.  You don't get any stickers or badges for doing it, but I think it's an awesome way to see the Valley and the River--an awesome way to spend three hours or three days, depending on how much you wanna do.  Also, it's like 4 or 5 really good dates (bring a cooler!).    

BONUS!  Wife's Luis's avocado sauce recipe:   

* One avocado  

* One cup Herdez salsa verde (or homemade)  

* 2-3 cloves garlic  

* fresh jalapeno to taste  

* juice from half a lime  

* 1/4 cup sour cream  

* pinch of salt  

* pinch of cumin  

Throw it all in the blender until the consistency is even.  Pour it into an empty bottle of squeezy mustard for easy dispensing.

The Graham Nash show is not sold out(yet) so I realize there is little incentive to get my ticket instead of from the location.

This is an incredibly long shot. But maybe I'll luck out and emergency responders and portland PD are hanging out in this subreddit.

I'm trying to find more information about this wreck that happened Friday night in your city.  My father is currently in the ICU at Legacy Emanuel.  He's all kinds of banged up, broken ribs, spinal and neck fractures.  He was passenger in a car that was hit.  I believe the car he was in had 3 people, a husband and wife and my father.  

I've tried calling Portland PD's non emergency number and just got bounced around by an automated system.

For this newer, more expanded idea, so far we have one personal trainer, an RN, a nutritional counselor, a nurse practitioner, and a professional cook all interested or on board... but we want to put our feelers out there for any healers or practitioners of ANY aspect of health (really!) with an emphasis on Health At Every Size / body positive / social justice / feminist ideas. I would say the group shares a pretty integrative approach to health in terms of allopathic vs naturopathic and also a strong focus on self care and trauma-informed care.

Refuge seems to have essentially no web presence. Their facebook hasn't be updated in years. Their site says nothing and seems to offer the place up for corporate events more than a venue for DJs.

 I can't figure out when they open, if I need tickets or is there a door cover or anything. Anyone know what the story is?",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,What's up with Refuge?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3d5hn9/whats_up_with_refuge/,,,,,,,
