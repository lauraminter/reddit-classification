Most earthquakes around the world occur near major faultlines. For the past year, there have been a lot of earthquakes in NE Oklahoma, away from a faultline. In the last couple weeks, there have been a large number of small earthquakes in on spot near Lakeview, OR, which is in a remote area near the Nevada border. Looking for more information, there are a few minor mentions of this phenomenon in Oregon, and one facebook site on fracking in Oregon. It isn't necessarily confirmed, and this could still result from natural tectonic activity. http://volcanoscience.blogspot.com/2014/08/curious-quake-swarm-in-nw-nevada.html

 Oklahoma isn't the only location that fracking for natural gas occurs, but something about this Oklahoma geology or the specific approach they're using there has lead to hundreds of earthquakes in the range of 2.5-4.0. I don't see the same number of earthquakes in areas of Pennsylvania or north Dakota. It is still under dispute, but the situation has ended up in court as this causes a lot of hairline cracks in bricks and mortar in buildings, and has even caused someone's fireplace to fall over. http://www.pressherald.com/2015/01/30/earthquakes-rattle-oklahoma/",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,default,"Cluster of earthquakes near Lakeview, OR related to mining activity",http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2wzve3/cluster_of_earthquakes_near_lakeview_or_related/,,,

I'm trying to get a new roommate. live by 139th and division. 

Hi everyone, I'm looking for someone to rent a room in my house. The house itself is fairly spacious and has a nice big kitchen, big living room, washer and dryer, and a big private back yard. The bedroom is a decent size at 12ft by 14 ft i believe (don't quote me on that, but It is close). Internet and utilities are included. Room is not furnished! (kitchen has been repainted since picture was taken)

About the Household:

I am a 27 year old guy. I'm pretty quiet and keep to myself. I'm into hiking, biking, gaming, and exploring new places.

My fiancee is a 25 year old woman, into a lot of the same things I'm into. She has an overly friendly cat. She plans on doing a lot of gardening this year.

Living in the house, there is an aquarium full of fish, a cockatiel, a dog, and three cats. Outside there is a macaw and some chickens. The dog is often times not at home. Due to how many animals we already have, we are not accepting any more large animals such as cats and dogs.

I would prefer my roommate to have similar interests, and drug free (besides maybe 420). We are LGBT friendly. I don't mind if the roommate is male or female. Due to the bird I cant have any smoking in the house. Since there are already so many animals on the property, I can't really accept any more pets, besides maybe things that would stay in an aquarium or cage.

Room, including utilities is 500 a month, plus a refundable $250 deposit. Background check will be done, and would also like some rental references.
