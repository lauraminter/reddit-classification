A guy was tailgating me in the left lane of i84-- I was going 65mph and passing cars that were in the right lanes but not going fast enough for the asshole behind me apparently. He passed me in the right lane, got in front of me and slammed on his brakes and STOPPED on the highway. I was about killed. I am 7 months pregnant so me and my baby we're both almost killed. Because he was mad I wasn't going faster. It's so fucked up. 

He stayed stopped/crawling for a good minute making everyone behind me have to slam on their brakes. It is so unbelievable. I have a car speakerphone so I called 911 and gave them his license plate number (he tried speeding off but traffic got kind of bad so he got stuck and I was right behind him.) I couldn't tell the make and model of the car- no brand names, just a weird emblem I didn't recognize. 

Do you think my 911 call explaining he STOPPED on the highway and reporting his license plate # will do anything? People like this just don't deserve to have a license D:

After seeing the ClearChoice Dental commercials on TV she went in and had an appointment to figure out her options. ClearChoice does pretty much the same procedure but they use 4 implants as anchor points on the top and bottom. The quote for all of this work was $48k. Now I know dental work is expensive and I wasn't expecting this to be cheap but WOW. This is all out of pocket expenses as ClearChoice doesn't work with her insurance. Anyone have a good experience with any other places that do similar procedures to ClearChoice in PDX? ,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Can anyone recommend a good place to get dental implants in PDX?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2vpqo7/can_anyone_recommend_a_good_place_to_get_dental/,1423788446.0,t2_lbr9t,,,,,
