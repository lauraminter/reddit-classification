I found this seller in Gresham offering a bike that looked like what I wanted, but I kept looking just to see what else there was.  Then I found another one that looked like a potential winner, and another...  Then I noticed that there were a few more that looked like they had all been listed by the same person.

Now, could be somebody has a totally legit repair-and-resale operation going on from home to make some extra dough, and bully for them if they do.

Having said that:

1.  http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/bik/5557642539.html

5.  http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/bik/5557627315.html

Here's what smells funny to me:

* All appear to be taken with the same camera, possibly on the same day--I know it's Portland and there are lots of grey days that look the same, but the quality of the photos and the quality of the light seems very similar overall, plus all the listings were updated just before 10 this morning.  I tried to check EXIF data, but CL strips it, as expected.

* The two trek bikes have the same contact phone number.  In the pics of the Cannondale and the Schwinn, you can see the same piece of black rubber matting lying in the driveway.  The location, price, and writing style of the Diamondback listing also leads me to believe that these bikes are all from the same seller.

* Why phone numbers on two of them and not the other three, even though I am pretty sure they are being sold by the same seller?  Why no references to other bikes for sale in the same listing?  Why keep moving the bikes around to take the pictures, just for the sake of artistic variety?  Circumstantial evidence, but still, I could see someone doing all of these things if they were trying to look like they weren't the same person doing all this shit.

What do you guys think?  I am admittedly paranoid, but I don't want to contribute to Portland's stolen bike problem.  :/

EDIT:  So the person texted me their address as the meeting point.  I Google-maps'ed it and saw that it was the same place the CL photos were taken.  I figured either they were legit or they were breaking Crack Commandment #5.  The person was nice.  Clearly very into bikes, but no warning vibes were felt.  We chatted for a while.  They gave me a good deal on a different bike, since the first one ended up being too small.  When I got home, I ran the bike's serial on the index and nothing came up.  I feel like I did my part.

That may sound harsh, but resources are limited.  Beds are limited.  Mental health services are limited.  Healthcare services are limited.  Dollars to pay for it all are limited.

Let's imagine some billionaire benefactor comes along and pours tens of millions of dollars into our homeless crisis.  Build homes for the homeless?  Done!  Healthcare?  Paid for.  Job training and other services?  Paid for!  What would happen next?  Initially, there'd be a significant drop in homelessness here.  Hooray!  But there would be a significant increase in the amount of homeless people coming here and we'd be right back where we are now, only with a significantly larger homeless population.

I want to be clear: Housing the homeless is good, but is it Portland's job to house the entire west coast's homeless?

And that's the harsh reality nobody wants to discuss.  Perhaps some people haven't thought of that yet?  I don't know.

I've been living downtown for nearly 15 years and I've never seen it this bad.  I've never seen so many homeless people at night, sleeping on sidewalks, under doorways, anywhere and everywhere.  And that's not even mentioning the campers.  Our mayor and city council have basically created new Hoovervilles, but with tents instead of cardboard.  The numbers are horrifying.

During the day, the city is filled with wanderers.  That makes sense in that people without homes doesn't have a place to be, so, they wander.

The wanderers seem like they're a different group than the rest of the homeless.  They're almost always male, and it seems like a lot of them aren't from here.  I'm often asked where the liquor store is, or where a 7/11 is.  If I mention a Plaid Pantry, I'll be asked ""Is that like a 7/11?""

How could these guys be on the streets in Portland and not know that?  It's as if they're not from here.  That's because many of them aren't from here.

""Where are you from?""  *""Ashland.""*

""Where are you from?""  *""Idaho.""*

""Where are you from?""  *""Eugene.""*

""Where are you from?""  *""Sacramento.""*

""Where are you from?""  *""Oh, I'm just passing through, y'know?""*

How can Portland possibly find a solution to our homeless problem when so much of our homeless population isn't from Portland, and when more homeless are arriving here every day?  I realize all big cities face a similar situation, where homeless people come to the city, but in Portland, we're not talking about it at all.

How many among our homeless population are from our burbs?  How many are from further out in Oregon?  How many aren't even from Oregon?  We don't have enough money or resources locally to solve a regional or national problem.

I don't have any answers.  But I'm at least hoping to get a conversation going, especially since the candidates running for mayor don't seem to have a clue.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Portland Homelessness discussions seem to miss the obvious,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/4gl26x/portland_homelessness_discussions_seem_to_miss/,1358708298.0,t2_aaqz1,homeless,Homeless,,,,,

They want to schedule an appraisal of my property. I'd prefer to not let them in--both because I like privacy and because I don't want my taxes to increase. What's my legal obligation though, do I have to let them in? What happens if I don't? Can they reassess my house without entering it? 

More detail: I purchased the home ~1year ago. It had been remodeled by a previous owner (a local construction company), who had apparently pulled permits, did some work, but then never completed the final inspections. I don't know what the house looked like before, or when it was remodeled (it's &gt;100 years old) but I know that the tax records don't match reality (we have 3 bathrooms, Portland Maps says 2). 

About 5 months after we moved in, I got an email from the previous owners, asking if they could do a final inspection. I was annoyed with them, because of some shoddy work that didn't show until the house had been lived in a bit. I wrote back and said, ""sure, you can schedule an inspection, as soon as you fix the shower tile, which was done incorrectly and probably wouldn't pass inspection."" (I don't know if it's true that it wouldn't pass inspection, I just wanted them to fix their crappy work.) I never heard from them again. If I don't let the inspector in, is the previous owner/remodeler in possible trouble for never completing inspections? Am I? 

And final question--if they do reassess the house, does it just include the value of additional improvements, or do they reassess the entire house? In other words, if a house is assessed at X, but really is worth 2X, and I add a 15K bathroom, is the new assessed value going to be X+15K, or 2X+15K?",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Mult. Co.

They got into the fuse box, I'm guessing it was to check for more rock candy. Nothing in there. I bet they got excited, thinking they found some yummy, nummy meth. Maybe there was more?!

In the glovebox? Nope, the only thing found was the rest of the elementary school science project. The opened bag had the largest sugar crystals we made over the week, so it was disappointing to throw them away.

The bastard stepped all over our glovebox paper napkins. It took a while to build those up. It felt like Rick James had fucked my couch, you know?

Our truck is super clean and empty now, thank you. I also was able to tell my wife ""I told you so"" about checking to make sure her side of the vehicle is locked. Well, kinda. I was careful with my words. 

I'll be boobying the truck for you next time, so it'll be unlocked. Nothing harmful or dangerous, mind you, but it may contribute to a psychological complex when checking random vehicle doors. I love minor pranks.

And, thank you for not taking those permits. Why didn't you take all the quarters? Too noisy to carry while checking other vehicles down the street?

After signing up several weeks back and scheduling our install for this past weekend, the fiber line installers came out Friday, as promised.  They ran the line down to our house, explained that the installer would be out the next day to run the line to the box, etc.  On Saturday, we had a 9am-1pm appointment window for the installer to come.  He called at 9am on the dot and said he would be there in 20 minutes.  Once arrived, it took him about an hour and a half to do all the installation.  Then he checked that everything was working properly (he even had a wall phone to plug in and make sure the landline was working, which was super helpful, as we haven't had a landline in ages and will need to purchase a phone).  He showed us how to use the Prism TV features (that's their fiber based cable service, it's actually super sweet).  Set up the second wireless Prism box in our bedroom, programmed all our remotes for us, and then left.  He was extremely thorough and professional.

We signed up for the 100mb fiber (100 down/20 up) is the promised speed), and have performed three speed tests since Saturday.  We are getting 105 down/37 up every time.  Even the router is better than the one from Comcast.  We can now get wifi on our back deck, which we never could before.  All in all, EXTREMELY happy with this switch.  We're getting twice the speed for the same price we paid comcast, plus a way better TV service, again for the same price.  

Our neighbor down the street switched recently too, but had the typical nightmarish install experience that a lot of people warn about.  After about 3 weeks, they did eventually get it sorted out for him, and he's now getting the same speeds we are.  He said that although the install process was extremely frustrating for him, he's still glad he switched because of how much faster and more reliable it is.  No more throttling during peak streaming times, etc.  I guess it's a crapshoot with their install process, but for us, it went really smoothly and it's really fucking fast internet.  Yay.  Definitely encourage others to look into it!
