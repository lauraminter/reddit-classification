You're thirty-something, or maybe even late twenty-something. You've got a kid or two. Or three. Or maybe most of your friends do. You used to listen to Saves the Day and The Anniversary (or The Get Up Kids, or Piebald, or Hey Mercedes, or Cursive, or The Weakerthans, etc, etc) back in the 90s and 2000s. You probably were in your own shitty band back then too, and maybe even played some shows. Maybe at some point you got married and/or went to school and/or started a career, stopped playing, and maybe got rid of your gear... once or twice (or maybe you kept it around to collect dust for a bit). Now it's a decade and change later (holy shit!) and you're feeling that urge to be playing music again. To be on the stage, in front of a crowd again (or let's be honest, to be in front of 7 of your buddies, including all band members' SOs/parents, and a whole lot of empty chairs). But now you've got a career, and/or a family, so there's no way you're gonna be in a van skipping around the country borderline starving with a bunch of fellow unwashed delinquents, hoping that the club you're headed to will pay you enough to make it to the next place. But you've got some gear, some skill (however rusty it may be), an urge to perform, and a bit of time to set aside to make it happen (call it once a week?).

Hi. You're my people. Let's start making some music. Let's take that music and inflict it on some other people, who might even, despite their better judgement, actually like it. I play guitar. I'm looking for ~~a bassist,~~ a drummer, and someone that can lay down some keys. Any ability to sing would be celebrated, but not required. Dudes and ladies alike are welcome. Maybe you'd like a beer or a bowl while playing. Or not. It's cool. Here's some stuff I've been working on: https://soundcloud.com/thelonggoodnight.

Shoot me a message or reply here if you're interested. Cheers!

* Bicyclists and pedestrians not illuminated (I *literally* cannot see you). Where's the enforcement on this?
* Drivers/passengers parallel parked on streets enter/exit their cars without looking for oncoming traffic and just open their doors into the travel lanes (see this everyday)
* Cars going way too fast or too slow; cars that do not adjust to weather conditions properly or are too conservative
* Street lights appear inadequate and do not illuminate enough (I'd be curious to see photometrics of different cities compared to ours). Everything seems dim even with new LED lights
* Bicyclists ""lane split"" on non-bike lane streets and sidle up to cars who may be trying to make a turn and don't see the bicyclist on their side
* Inability as a driver to see people crossing crosswalks (too dark or pedestrian does not give a commitment to crossing or pedestrian darts into traffic unfairly).
* Cars blatantly not stopping for people in crosswalks
* Cars parked waaaayy too close to intersections that blocks visibility of cars/bikes/pedestrians -- I literally cannot see when I turn at some intersections.
* Red light runners
* Cannot see a street sign at night to save my life. Has the city every considered reflective material for these signs for night time visibility? 

Where's the enforcement of some of these safety measures? Where is the city addressing some of these issues? For instance, I've driven E Burnside a few times at night and the new crosswalks are good during the day generally, but they are hard to see people trying to cross while driving the speed limit (e.g., pedestrians are hidden behind parallel parked cars and street illumination is weak especially at crosswalks).

Where I am confused, is the E. Burnside did receive some money to make it safer, but in some regards the new design has made it unsafe in other areas.

He was lost in the area near NE Schute and Cornell Rd.

He responds to ""Riley"" and kissy noises, and knows the command ""wait!"", but please call us before shouting to him as he may get spooked. My name is Arthur and my number is 503.964.8260. Please please please help us find him. 

Update: He was spotted the afternoon of 12/24 running east on the south side of Cornell, near 48th and that Costco.

Update 2: He was spotted in the Orenco neighborhoods behind New Seasons (Rosebay, Copper Beach).

UPDATE:  11:02pm The guy living in his van down the street still has his Xmas lights on.  No longer is he outshines by the surrounding residences.  

11:09pm:  Pooping by candlelight not as romantic as I expected.    

11:14pm:  #4 bus seemingly unaffected.   

11:17pm:  Residents of apartment building on Ivanhoe exchanging vape shop recommendations.  

11:22pm:  That Toyota Previa driver totally just blew through the intersection of Lombard and Philadelphia.   

11:24pm:  Walking back to check on vinegar.  Phone at 31%.   

11:27pm:  Non-heteronormative tween that lives next to that weird porn house on N Chicago is feeding xer pet duck--as always.  EDIT: A pronoun.   

11:33pm:  Opened a bottle of Pelican Cold Coast Pilsner.  Pouring it into an IPA glass because all my Pilsner glasses are in the basement.   

11:38pm:  Neighbors not blasting 80s pop music because power is still out.  I like the lack of George Michael right now.

12:04am: 7-11 on Lombard and St. Louis is closed but their delivery truck is here and there is confusion.  

12:10am:  The Bluebird Tavern has power and is PACKED.  There are two overweight girls smoking cigarettes and talking about how Garrett is nice because he wiped the rain off the outdoor seats for them.  Also, one of the girls says it was difficult for her to see Star Wars twice in the same day because she's overweight.  
  
12:16am: Brekkens has power but is either dead or closed.  Two dudes are hitting on the overweight girls.  They are wearing black hoodies and don't know anything about Star Wars.   

12:20am:  Marvel 29 has power.  $1225 for a 1bd/1ba.
