The primary vote date is  May 19, 2020  
The registration to vote deadline is April 28th, however the DMV is closed until April 28th (and we don't know if it'll be extended based on whatever unpredictably happens in the future)

Because of my UI income (as a single person with no dependents), I don’t qualify for OHP. I submitted an OHP application and I can confirm that I was denied. 

I intend to look at Marketplace insurance, which will probably cost me around $300 a month. I’m not that tight on money, especially if the new stimulus package comes through. Still, this system seems nonsensical. If the government insists that health insurance be tied to employment, then shouldn’t unemployment insurance be tied to Medicaid (or at least not hinder your ability to get Medicaid)? Im not trying to get into a messy, political conversation but please tell me I’m not the only one that sees the absurdity in this. 

Well anyway, is anyone in the same boat? Also, I am caught up on the new stimulus bill that involves the $1200 payment, expanding unemployment insurance, etc. For those of you that are more informed about politics, do you think that Medicaid income qualifications related to UI will become more lenient?

My name is Josiah. I'm a Bartender here in Portland. I've been working the last few years on my concept to open up a small owner-operated cocktail bar. I have everything together for it except for the funding part.

I got laid off from my full-time bar tending gig when the state closed down dine in restaurants and bars. As much as it sounds nice to sit around and watch Netflix during this time, my mind is obsessive &amp; I am passionate about this project, so I'm putting in a lot of work right now. 

I'm building a compact mobile cocktail cart that I can roll into different establishments (i.e. retail spaces, coffee shops, restaurants w/o alcohol) and run a small bar program for a couple of days using the OLCC's Temporary service license. It would give me proof of concept, exposure to my company, &amp; something to show potential investors. I think it might be a cool way to fill in unused space and time for a business as well and make a little extra money. 

If anyone would be down to talk about it, I think we could potentially come up with a cool collaboration. Feel free to PM me. (also, if you want me to cater a party or something like that we could do that too.)

1.) I didn’t receive the non compete 14 days prior to my first date of employment.

I've probably spent about 2 hours outside over the course of two weeks. Started feeling icky a couple days ago- cough, chest burning and tightness, all that good stuff they tell you on the CDC website. My employers health plan was not ACA compliant so I shopped for private insurance at the low low price of $300 a month at the beginning of the month before all this happened and plan will not be in effect until April 1st.....awesome. My options were limited. 211 referred me to virginia Garcia who referred me to providence's ER. Virginia cannot take any new patients for the virus and cant give tests to people who arent patients apparently. Providence said come in and they can take make the determination whether or not I qualify. 


Got to providence, nurses and doctors all dressed up as expected for pandemic. One person allowed in at a time in the lobby. Go up to the front and explain my symptoms, they give me a mask and run a thermometer all over my head. No fever. Super cool! Was given a pink slip and sent to a second lobby down a corridor. Staff cleaning the entire lobby, I get seen by a nurse who takes more information from me about symptoms behind a desk, dressed appropriately. She takes my ID and my insurance card and says she will try to get them to backbill my visit (awesome!). While she was talking to me, she mentioned that while they are expecting that the tests and visits will be free for people who are uninsured, they have no way of knowing right now. She wants to help people, but they can only do so much. I'm directed to sit and will be seen soon. There was only me and one other person there so that went fast. The lobby was empty and extremely quiet, which is very unusual I think for immediate care. Get called back 10 minutes later, chart updated, take vitals, etc. My blood pressure was very high which was unusual. The med tech mentions the doctor will be in soon. 


20 minutes later she comes. Go over symptoms a 3rd time. Takes additional vitals, lungs, etc. She explained that I didnt qualify for testing because I am not immunocompromised or elderly but I very likely have it. She let slip how they are only allowed to do so many tests a day so they have to pick and choose very carefully. I'm not surprised. Everything's fucked. I get a prescription for benzononate and albuterol to ease my coughing and breathing issues. Said to call the virtual desk if it gets worse before coming in. I tell her I've been getting worse over the last few days but I understand.  Had a little laugh about that. Discharged with some coupons so I only have to pay $40 for the meds. The office visit itself is another story....


So I'm waiting to get them from rite aid. The security guards arent letting people in who have the virus or show symptoms. My prescriptions are probably done so I'm going to attempt to get them.


Idk if anyone else has had to go thru if, I figured a write up from an uninsured person will help others try to find some guidance. The reason I held off was because of money, lack of insurance and no idea where to begin. There are options out there if you're scared or worried. They will do what they can to help. Hopefully this will help someone who feels as helpless as I felt. ❤

Text of email I got:

""To our dear employees,
 
We hope that you are staying safe during this COVID-19 crisis. It has undoubtedly impacted everyone in ways we could not have imagined. We need to let you know that tomorrow's payroll will be delayed until at least next Wednesday. Saying we’re sorry we know isn’t enough, but please know that we are sorry beyond words for this delay. We know how deeply this delay is impacting you and your family during this extremely trying time and we are doing everything we can to get this nailed down next week and to get payroll into your accounts as quickly as we possibly can. If you receive a check in the mail, we ask that you please wait until at least Wednesday to cash it.
 
This has been a heartbreaking realization for us to work through, knowing how much it hurts you, the heart and soul of the company. We can’t stress enough how hard we are working on these issues. The weight is on our shoulders and we are doing everything we can to get you paid as quickly as possible and to keep the company afloat so that McMenamins is here for you when this pandemic is over.
 
If you know of anyone that did not receive this email, it is because we do not have their personal email contact. We will be calling employees for whom we do not have email addresses for.
 
Due to how quickly things are changing, we will continue to use email to reach out to everyone. Please also keep an eye on our main social media channels on Facebook and Instagram for when we will be reopening. We are currently closed throughout Oregon and Washington until at least April 16. But we will reopen as soon as we feel it is safe and we are able to!

Highlights: 

&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Institute analysis of 597,000 small businesses from February to October 2015 found that half of the companies held a cash buffer large enough to support 27 days of business. Half do not.   
&gt;  
&gt;Cash buffer days are the number of days that a business can continue paying its typical outflows — such as payroll, purchasing supplier, or loan repayment — without bringing in any money, in the form of things like revenue, tax rebates, or transfers from investors' or owners' private savings.   
&gt;  
&gt; The median number of cash buffer days across all small businesses was 27 days. And, a quarter of small businesses hold fewer than 13 cash buffer days in reserve.    
&gt;  
&gt; Some industries have less of a buffer than others. On median, restaurants only have 16 buffer days, in part because of how labor-intensive they are to operate. The lack of buffer is becoming a massive problem currently, as restaurants and bars are forced to stop serving customers due to the coronavirus outbreak, sparking fear that [many will close for good.](https://www.eater.com/2020/3/19/21185918/how-can-goverment-assistance-help-restaurants-actually-need-in-the-form-of-relief) 

I'm not defending these businesses in particular(or owners who are perceived as callous in some cases) but as a former small business owner myself I empathize with folks on both sides of this. During my 12 years as a business owner many people assumed I was rolling in cash and didn't pay more or offer more benefits because I was greedy or because the market didn't demand it. The truth is almost all of my friends who had regular day jobs were earning more than me. My overhead was relatively low so I probably could have survived 2 months or so without cash flow but that's it. 

A couple things to note: this is normal for small businesses. If you think a business should 100% have the ability to pay all its bills without cash flow or not be in business you may be right but most of the small business you enjoy wouldn't exist and we would live in a world of chains and conglomerates. Maybe that's the trade off. I also believe that's why most small businesses have a shelf life. Ever wonder why a place that is awesome and seems slammed might close? Fixed costs always go up and when the owner is over is suffering from burnout and can't afford a manager something has to give. And finally no one could have predicted this.",True,False,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,149821,public,self,"For those wondering why some small businesses are struggling to pay their bills here's an informative article.
