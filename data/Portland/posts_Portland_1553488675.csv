Not my hands, my whole body. I don't know where to turn, so excuse this raw post as I share it here.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, my name is S. I'm a female in my late 20's and am an independent, curious, intelligent spirit. I have a good head on my shoulders, but I'm in a bit of trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I came to Portland (from Florida) on a visit. Well, the visit turned into me falling in love with the city and I ended up staying for almost a year. It was scary not knowing anyone and starting over, but I endured! I got myself two jobs, met some amazing friends in the process, and started looking at apartments. While I was doing so, I got a call that my uncle had died in a motorcycle accident back home. My aunt, whom I love dearly, was distraught and was drinking heavily. It sounded like she had hit rock bottom, so I quit both of my jobs and flew back across the country immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since the end of December, I've been here with her. I thought I could help her, but her drinking has gotten worse. She can't go a day without getting drunk, while I've had many heart to hearts telling her how it makes me feel and how I'm worried about her. I've offered countless times to pick her up from wherever she is to drive her home, but she insists on drinking and driving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night was one of the worst I've seen her. I woke up to car alarms blaring at 2am. Worried, I rushed outside to see what was happening. I saw that she was absolutely wasted and had backed into her fountain in her front yard (even though there's no need to go into reverse, because it's on a loop). She put the car in park (still stuck in the fountain) and promptly fell out of the door. She wasn't hurt thankfully, but was so drunk she couldn't stand or speak. She blamed the car for the accident.

&amp;#x200B;

When she was sober today, I had a talk with her (I've lost count how many times I've expressed concern) and told her that it's going to come to the point where she's either going to get a DUI or kill someone/herself while driving under the influence. She says she knows and she's fine. I told her it's not fine and that she's putting other people's lives at risk. I asked her if she would consider a rehab/treatment facility and she got aggressive. This isn't the first time I've asked nor the first time she's gotten defensive.

&amp;#x200B;

This has all been very taxing on me. I'm not sure what to do anymore, and I think it's time I separated myself from what has become a toxic situation. I'm depressed and I'm scared. I'm afraid it's going to get to the point... soon... where she doesn't like me being concerned and she's going to kick me out. I don't have anywhere else to go, nor do I want to stay in Florida. I only came back for her because she asked me to.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to take precautions if this happens (my gut says it will) so this is where I need help. I desperately want to come back to Portland, get back to work, and just try my best to be happy. I would like to find a piece of land, perhaps on someone's property, where I can put a self sustained tiny house. Finding a backyard shared with loving people is a daunting task being all the way across the country. I've asked my friends that are there, but they are all renting houses at the moment and don't know of anyone in their neighborhood looking to put a tiny house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I need help. If any kind people here can point me in a good direction I would appreciate it. Maybe you have a friend or neighbor who would be interested in helping a sweet soul. Maybe that person is you! I really need help, and I'm not one to ask for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate your time and am sending you any positive energy I have left in me.

If you have someone interested I would be happy to send any other information they need to make them more comfortable.

* this would be my 14th tattoo, I know what I'm doing and how ridiculous this post seems but I'm well intentioned pls don't hurt me 
* yes I know ""cheap = bad"" I've dropped my fair share of green on quality ink, this would literally be 5 small tally marks, my smallest tattoo to date
* pls don't get on me about ""it'll age like shit"" I know what's up 

this Sunday 3/24 will be my 5 year health anniversary, meaning it has been 5 years since my last hospitalization. I was diagnosed with reoccurring acute pancreatitis at age 10 and it really kicked my ass as a kid. I grew up only going about 8 months between hospitalizations if I was lucky so the fact that I've made it 5 years is legit one of my biggest life accomplishments. I'm just getting out of finals week so I was preoccupied until just recently and tonight I was racking my brain on ways to celebrate. I just realized how much I would love 5 small tally marks near some old hospital related scars on the back of my arm. I could (hopefully) keep adding to the marks each year. 

the problem: I'm a broke ass college kid. I would contact my usual artist but she's out of town and her shop is appointment only so a walk-in isn't an option there. Most shops have a $100 minimum and I just have such a hard time throwing 2 weeks worth of grocery money at this tiny tattoo, sure the sentiment is worth it, but a girls gotta eat. If anybody knows of a shop, or an artist in particular who would be willing to help me out pls hit me up. willing to travel, asap would be best otherwise I'll just hit up my usual artist when she's back in town in a couple months. it's not the end of the world if I don't find anybody, I just wasn't having any luck w google so I figured I'd ask reddit just in case I was missing something. again, I realize how ridiculous this post sounds pls don't hurt me. thanks for reading if you made it this far!!
