News Release from Portland Police Bureau
Posted on FlashAlert: February 26th, 2015 11:14 AM

On February 21, 2015, East Precinct officers responded to the report of a burglary at a home in the 13200 block of Northeast Shaver Street. 

Officers arrived and contacted the victim, an 82-year-old man, residing at the home. The victim told police that on February 20, at approximately 1:00 p.m., someone knocked on his door. The victim answered the door and the suspect was standing outside, wearing an orange safety vest and carrying a clipboard. The victim told police that the suspect claimed he was checking water in the area due to reports that the water was brown. 

The victim told police that he allowed the suspect to enter his home to check the water. The victim told police that the suspect did not check the sink, instead he asked to go down to the basement, where they spent 15 minutes checking water and talking. 

The victim told police that he and the suspect then went back upstairs and the suspect left. After the suspect left, the victim noticed that his desk had been rummaged through and items were missing. 

Based on the information provided by the victim, detectives believe the suspect had an accomplice who came into the home while he and the victim were in the basement. 

The suspect is described as an African American male, 50-64 years old, 5'7"" tall, medium build, lighter-skin, and a pock-marked face. 

The suspect's truck is described as a white, extended cab 4x4, with chrome wheels. The truck had no distinguishing marks or logos. 

The Portland Water Bureau wants you to know that although Water Bureau employees may knock on your door to ask water-related questions, they will very rarely ask to enter your home. 

If someone claiming to be from the Portland Water Bureau asks to enter your home, ask to see a City-issued ID and/or verify that they are a Water Bureau employee by calling (503) 823-4874. 

The Police Bureau also recommends that people share this information with family and friends to prevent future incidents. 

Anyone with information about this suspect is asked to contact the Burglary Detail via email, burglary@portlandoregon.gov.

My name is Josh and my BF's name is Mykel.  We are looking for someone to live with in the Portland area to keep our living expenses down.  We are looking for someone that is LGBT friendly and around our age to get an apartment with.  Having similar interests would be great too!

I am 28 and work at Fred Meyer in the Electronics department. Mykel is 22 and also works at Fred Meyer in the Home department.  

Our budget is around $800/mo total but would love to find a place where we could pay 2/3rds of the rent and utilities for anything less than that too :)

We are both avid gamers and also foodies.  I enjoy cooking and frequently make delicious food that I love to share!  

We have two dogs, one Australian Shepard / Jack Russell terrier mix and one Chihuahua/Pomeranian mix.  They get along well with dogs and are very nice.  

We are both straight acting and are not the partying types.  Very low key and respectful of other people's space.  We have been living together for a little over 2 years and are most definitely in it for the long run.

On March 11, 2011 at 2:46 PM local time, a magnitude 9.0 megathrust earthquake struck off the east coast of Honshu, Japan.  This massive earthquake and resulting tsunami that swept onshore in Japan within 30 minutes devastated northern Honshu.  On January 26, 1700 at about 9 PM local time, a great Cascadia subduction zone earthquake caused widespread destruction from northern California to western British Columbia and generated a tsunami that, as Native American groups retell, “put the canoes in the trees.”  Similar to the modern example, that tsunami caused damage and deaths across the Pacific in Japan where it is known as the Orphan Tsunami of 1700 AD.  These mirror-image natural disasters separated by 311 years raise Earth science education and emergency preparedness questions of enormous human consequence.  EarthScope’s Plate Boundary Observatory array of GPS receivers is measuring the compression of the “leading edge” of the North American continental margin as it stores elastic energy that will be released in the next Cascadia megathrust earthquake.  The discovery of Episodic Tremor and Slip has provided new insight into the dynamics of subduction zone plate boundaries.  Development of a coordinated GPS and seismic monitoring network holds great promise for Cascadia Earthquake Early Warning.  In Japan, Chile, and California, considerable progress has been made in earthquake engineering as these regions approach earthquake resilience.  How can we translate and disseminate earthquake science for novice learners to advance public understanding of earthquake hazards and develop a regional commitment to build an earthquake resilient Cascadia?  One pedagogical approach is to animate plate tectonic and earthquake processes by compressing time from centuries to seconds and scaling dimensions from 100s of kilometers on and beneath Earth’s surface to centimeters on a computer screen.  Example animations of ghost forests as records of the 1700 earthquake, EarthScope GPS observations, and the concept of Cascadia Earthquake Early Warning, will be presented.

On March 11, 2011 at 2:46 PM local time, a magnitude 9.0 megathrust earthquake struck off the east coast of Honshu, Japan.  This massive earthquake and resulting tsunami that swept onshore in Japan within 30 minutes devastated northern Honshu.  On January 26, 1700 at about 9 PM local time, a great Cascadia subduction zone earthquake caused widespread destruction from northern California to western British Columbia and generated a tsunami that, as Native American groups retell, “put the canoes in the trees.”  Similar to the modern example, that tsunami caused damage and deaths across the Pacific in Japan where it is known as the Orphan Tsunami of 1700 AD.  These mirror-image natural disasters separated by 311 years raise Earth science education and emergency preparedness questions of enormous human consequence.  EarthScope’s Plate Boundary Observatory array of GPS receivers is measuring the compression of the “leading edge” of the North American continental margin as it stores elastic energy that will be released in the next Cascadia megathrust earthquake.  The discovery of Episodic Tremor and Slip has provided new insight into the dynamics of subduction zone plate boundaries.  Development of a coordinated GPS and seismic monitoring network holds great promise for Cascadia Earthquake Early Warning.  In Japan, Chile, and California, considerable progress has been made in earthquake engineering as these regions approach earthquake resilience.  How can we translate and disseminate earthquake science for novice learners to advance public understanding of earthquake hazards and develop a regional commitment to build an earthquake resilient Cascadia?  One pedagogical approach is to animate plate tectonic and earthquake processes by compressing time from centuries to seconds and scaling dimensions from 100s of kilometers on and beneath Earth’s surface to centimeters on a computer screen.  Example animations of ghost forests as records of the 1700 earthquake, EarthScope GPS observations, and the concept of Cascadia Earthquake Early Warning, will be presented.
