One of the eggs you threw for fun, struck me in the eye. The splinter of egg shells cut the white of my left eye. It gives me trouble to open. 

When I was in high school, I had friends who harassed strangers. They threw eggs, they squirted people with squirt guns, they stole lawn ornaments. They were miserable then, and even more so now. 

I'm not angry or surprised people like you exist. People like you are plentiful. Plentiful, hateful, self-loathing, and unhappy. Inflicting your pain on the rest of us, instead of looking inward and seeking help. I mainly feel sorry for you. Your life trajectory looks bleak. 

My eye will heal and I'll move on. But you, who lacks empathy or decency, even if you become wealthy or successful, you'll likely still be miserable.  

For context:

We were stopped at a light in opposing directions, once it turned green I rode across the intersection. The stayed stopped in their car waiting for my husband and me to pass. They threw a few eggs in front of us which missed.  I slowed down to avoid them, almost at a standstill and turned my head to look, (5-7ft away from them). I saw this kid's upper body completely out of the car. He PURPOSEFULLY hit me square in the face. He aimed straight for my face. The force of it made my skin bleed. I remember the look in his eyes, I represented something to him and he was angry at me for it.

If you want to see some totality, but don't have a place selected, I would suggest heading down to Sublimity.  Check traffic cams before using I-5; 1st alternate is Hwy99E from I-205; 2nd alternate is Hwy 213 form I-205.

Silverton might be a choke point.  If so, there is a Roth/IGA supermarket north of town on 1st St where you can park, view from there and get snacks.
Note: the Oregon Garden will be closed that day for a ticket-only Sprint event.

If traffic is light, continue south to Sublimity.

There are many wide open spaces in Sublimity; [here is a park 2 blocks west of the main drag](https://www.google.com/maps/@44.8307757,-122.7965769,3a,75y,40.84h,90.49t/data=!3m10!1e1!3m8!1svPD-38UA5-7fPWyRrYOBFA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DvPD-38UA5-7fPWyRrYOBFA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D265.64313%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i45!5m1!1e4)

If the park is crowded, you can just drive east on one of the country roads &amp; [pick a place to park such as this](https://www.google.com/maps/@44.8276969,-122.7708049,3a,75y,274.01h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sK9MU1DVv9M9Kczd0y6Skpw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DK9MU1DVv9M9Kczd0y6Skpw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D354.74097%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656).

For the brave, try driving a few miles south to Stayton, which is at the center of totality.  For you nostalgic old-timers: there is an A&amp;W in town with the original drive-up stalls that have their own ordering window with intercom.  And yes, the girls will bring out your food on a tray that hangs on your driver's window.

Edit: Thanks to all. I went with Lyft, we zipped down there a few hours ago and I'm already back home with the car I needed to bring back. It was about 60 bucks. I tipped generously because I had budgeted $75. My driver was fantastic and the ride down was a hoot. We jabbered the whole way. The prize is that I brought home a 2006 Toyota Corolla that was driven from NY to OR. Even after that trip, it has 18,000 miles on it.

We think we saw it heading north on 99 around 7:45pm being towed by a light colored car. It has Viking written on the side and has teal and pink stripes and a bent back bumper. It's an older model and has greenish/teal canvas. We had packed all of our camping and fishing gear into it and have invested a lot of time working on it and trying to fix it up. 

We don't have much to offer but will give a $100 reward to any information leading to its return.

But tonight's activities? I just wanted to say thank you for being as respectful, orderly, and polite as you all were. You all streamed past my car and were nothing but pleasant to me. A few of you even apologized (genuinely) for blocking traffic. Nobody touched my car, nobody came *close* to threatening or intimidating.

So, I just wanted to say thanks. I'm not exactly the most pro-protest guy on here, so it's only fair that I call out people who operate these things the right way like it was tonight.
