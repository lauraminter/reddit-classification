Well, maybe not you, but your passenger had a brush with death at about 5:15 because of you.

You were turning off of Skyline onto Burnside just west of the tunnel. You made your turn into the (too short of a) merge/acceleration lane then immediately tried to cut into the main travel lane. I was doing 40mph - I would be surprised if you were doing 10. I almost put my front right bumper into your car just behind your rear passenger door. You are lucky to have not killed your passenger for 2 reasons:    
1) My truck is barely a year old and my brakes are fucking AWESOME. But even with 4 wheel ABS I locked every tire and heard the tires chirp on the pavement. Good thing the brakes of the cars behind me were pretty good too because no one went under my rear bumper as I had to panic break to avoid your stupid ass.   
2) I drive a pickup truck which allows me to easily mount curbs. Thanks to you, there are now tire tracks in the grass at the edge of Skyline Cemetery.

Why did this almost happen? BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T PAYING ANY FUCKING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING! You made a turn into an acceleration lane but didn't accelerate even though there was a long line of cars right behind me. You immediately swerved out of that acceleration lane and directly in front of me with MAYBE 15 or 20 feet of space. [At 40mph, it would take me 80 feet to stop](http://www.arachnoid.com/lutusp/auto.html) and that is only after I react to the situation.

If I had hit you, might left front bumper would have impacted just behind your rear passenger door. Your car would have been immediately spun sideways and crushed the front passenger against the strongest part of my car: the very front center. The passenger would have been crushed and if not killed, at least VERY badly injured. And what would have happened to my truck? Very little. My bumper would be finished, my radiator MIGHT have cracked. My airbags would have gone off to be sure, but most likely I would have gotten nothing more than a bump.

But you know what is even worse? I was LAYING on my horn while this happened and you barely twitched. Don't think I could see you? I could see you QUITE clearly. You looked all around as if wondering what the hell was going on! It wasn't until I was directly behind you again and flashed my high beams that you seemed to have ANY clue as to what had happened - and I am willing to lay money that as soon as you started to pull away you were immediately saying to yourself ""What is that asshole's problem?!"". Well if wanting to get home safely makes me an asshole, then that is what I am. But my problem is you and people just like you - you need to pay attention to what you are fucking doing!

But even with all that, I do have one thing to thank you for: I am bought a dashcam tonight and will be putting it in as soon as it arrives. Next time I encounter you or another reckless driver such as yourself, I am going to have video evidence of your inability to drive safely.

I just got things approved on my end to run this! Based on the interest from: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2rt1i1/portland_reddit_meetupevent_idea/

and the responses from: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2t321p/portland_redditors_winterhawks_meetup_v2/

I set this up for: **Friday, March 6, 2015 @ Moda Center. It’s Portland vs. Seattle at 7PM**

This is our biggest rival. When Portland plays in Seattle, the fans love to chant, “Portland Sucks.” And we always love to give them a hard time when they come here. Plus it’s going to be a really important game for playoff seeding. Each team also has a projected first rounder in the NHL Draft this spring.

*Pre-game anyone?* I couldn’t land you any beer deals, so if you would like to get a little saucy before the game, and **if we can get 25+ tickets purchased to the game, I’ll host a pre-game party at Stingray Café at 5:45PM.** Stingray is two blocks from the Moda Center at the Left Bank Annex. I can hand out hats, and I’ll do some games/trivia for some extra Winterhawks wearables.  This way by coming early you can snag some free street parking nearby, and get a good price on some micro-brews.

**Cost:** $20.50 per ticket for Center Ice Club Level seats together and it will come with a free Winterhawks trucker style hat. The Club level was renovated this summer, it's really nice. So you’ll be able to grab a drink at the bar, and hang out in some of the lounge seating between periods. 

We'll say what's up to the redditors on the big screen during 2nd intermission, that will happen. If we get tons of interest I'll do what I can to blow this thing up even more. Give me 50+ and I'll get something really cool going.

To purchase your tickets just go to the Ticketmaster website I have set up just for /r Portland: 

https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/winterhawks/EN/link/promotion/home/be528a23a061920699560fb4d3dc0139e2438a26   
and enter the promo code: **CHUGGERS**

Please feel free to spread the link around. The more the merrier. Friends and family are more than welcome!

My name is Richard and I'm currently seeking a model for a platinum blonde bleach and tone. This service will also include a free haircut, which is normally $60. I work at an upscale boutique salon in SE Portland, and need a model in within the next two weeks. My current price for a bleach and tone is $200+, and I need to provide a new model before my next price increase, showing that the the integrity of the hair is kept.

Like I said, everything will be free, and you will be given direction on how to maintain the tones in your hair, products you should be using, and overall knowledge of being a blonde, as education is a must.

There are a few requirements I'd like to ask: 
-Age 18+ -Hair type: Not heavily damaged or extremely long 
-Hair Color: No previous at home/box color, No natural color below a medium brown, no perm or relaxers. Virgin hair (natural color) would be the absolute best, but I understand that it's hard to find.

If you meet these specifics, or have any questions regarding the session, feel free to shoot me a message and we can speak further about moving this process along. If you are interested in the salon, and my background education, check out our website WINDOWWALLsalon.com.

I hope to get some responses, as I love a good platinum in the winter!
