I'm looking for some partners, for a deplorably unpopular activity in this general place-time we inhabit, but one that I find immensely fulfilling, in part due to its rarity perhaps, that I denote ""intellectual discussion"". I'm pretty broad about what this entails-- but at minimum it involves meeting up somewhere (typically over beer or coffee) with another interested and hopefully interesting individual to chat. The intent being that the greater part of the time together can be spent communicating about ideas, theories, models, constructions, arguments, considerations, and the like. Not so much the weather, if you catch my drift. 

I'm primarily a philosopher, but attempt to be an informed amateur about various sciences as well (which so far has been primarily: biology, physics, psychology/cognitive science, complexity/systems science). In conversations such as these I highly value the following: agnosticism/scepticism/a generally non-dogmatic attitude, playfulness/sense of humor/liveliness , detachment/engagement with the arguments and ideas with a minimum of emotional investment, ability to evaluate arguments and ideas ""in real time""/""thinking on one's feet"" as they say. 

Some of the topics upon which I often work include: Philosophy of Language, Mind, Information, &amp; Science; Epistemology, Metaphysics, Evolutionary Thinking, Fringe Ideas, Complexity, Emergence, Rhetoric, etc. etc. 

If this sort of thing sounds good, send me a message, let me know a bit about yourself (esp. in regards to your orientation toward inquiry) and maybe we can get together and give it a shot.

Figured you redditors could do some civic duty and help out. Being that I'm not in Portland anymore I thought of no better people to reach out to. 

Here's some images: http://imgur.com/a/xDRzW

Here's the FB post:

As many of you know, I just rode across country from Washington DC to Portland OR. My 2nd to last day visiting Portland, my touring bike, that I built myself, was stolen this morning sometime before 8am PST on west Burnside St (NW). I am absolutely heartbroken. I dont have many friends/connections here in Portland but posting this anyway to get the word out for those who are nearby. If you know people in Portland or surrounding area, please tag. Could be already in the marketplace or several weeks before the culprit sells it.

Details:
Surly - Long Haul Trucker 
Black 46cm frame
26'' wheels (Continental Tour Ride)
Honey colored Brooks leather saddle (possibly under black seat cover) and matching tan handlebar tape
Teal cable housing
Headset has a unique spacer thats a lime green beer bottle opener
Shimano bar end shifters
Black front rack (old man mountain) and back rack **the front rack cannot be removed unless they find a new quick release for hub mounting**
Front and back Planet Bike fenders **with lots of bright yellow reflective stickers**
The right of the top tube only says ""Trucker"" on it (compared to all/most LHT bc I scratched it off).
27 speed. Large chain ring is black, middle and small are silver.
Pedals are MKS step-in **flat on one side, clips on the other**
I had a nameplate on the back fender that said ""Megan"" from Natural Bridge, VA but likely was removed.

Unfortunately I dont have many pics of the bike unloaded because I finished building just before the trip.

************
UPDATE 1: My bike and I are still apart. I am still hurting. BUT, the love, support, and community I have felt from social media is unbelievable. You all sharing my story has made a HUGE difference in exposure. The local news picked up my story as well as the Oregonian. Unfortunately, there is nothing new about a bike theft story in Portland... but the story is not about theft. Its about people caring. And relating to my loss. And not wanting their beautiful city to be known for this. I promise you all I will not remember Portland for the loss of my 2-wheeled companion. 16,000 shares? That has given me more hope than I could ask for. Its a community search party! And we are going to find this bike to show what all of the ""good"" can do to outshine the few ""bad""! Thank you. Deeply.

************
UPDATE 2: REWARD $500
Three leads popped up in the last 12 hours but all unfortunately were dead ends. I know this is about so much more than money but your time and attention means the world to me. I am making flyers right now for a cash reward. $500 to whoever can get ahold of this bike or can provide the final lead

I have been visiting the aquarium off and on since it opened. It had recieved a lot of negative press, but I had always found the staff to be knowledgable, friendly, and the animals appeared to be well taken care of. 

I stopped by today and found the place nearly empty. Staff nowhere to be seen, tanks were dirty, there was only one person in their gift shop and no one was observing the touch tanks. Which is what they advertise as their main attraction. 

I tracked down a staff member to ask where everyone else was, but they couldn't say anything other than there was an owner was on-site and that they were currently hiring to replace staff. Which leads me to wonder, how many have left and why? 

After spending some time reading up on the various Boycott pages, I have decided I will not be returning. Google ""covino aquarium"" and take a look at the facebook pages below for more information.

I've moved back to the Portland area after being away for 14 years in Seattle.  Looking to meet new friends and find interesting things to do.

I don't drink, so not that interested in attending happy hour.  Just wondering if you have general recommendations based on the Meetups you've joined, based on cool people, subject material, etc.  I do have some specific interests, but I've explored those already.

I'm a 38 year old woman living in Portland, and one of my dearest friends is Claudia, an 89-year Parisian woman who lives in San Francisco. On a recent phone call with her she mentioned that she had had a fall and gone to the hospital, and that she's ""starting to forget things"". I'm not her family, and I worry her kids won't let me know if anything happens to her, so I want to get as much time with her as possible. She has always wanted to go on a cruise (more info on this in the 'backstory'), and I want to treat her to the trip of her dreams. She loves South America's romanticism, and wants to go on a cruise that doesn't allow kids, as she's not a big fan in her older age. She is funny, kind, crass and curses like a sailor. She is amazing - she has brought a lot of happiness to my life - and I want to return the favor while she's still mobile. 

Do you have any recommendations for cruises for 89-year old women and their 38-year old friends, Reddit?

Backstory from 2012: 

*So this morning I decided to check out an estate sale near my house in between sales calls. While there I heard a sweet, old woman talking about how she would like to go to another estate sale, but that since her husband died she didn't drive, and it would take her three buses and a 1/2 mile walk to get there. I had left the sale and was all the way to my car, when I decided to go back and offer her a ride. I wasn't sure how she would be cool with accepting a ride from a stranger with a shaved head and Indian spear earrings, but I offered anyway. 

Her face lit up. ""You would do that?"" She said. ""But, you don't even know me!"" 

OMG so cute. She was more worried about my being scared of her than of her being scared of me. I was already in love. 

And my love affair continued during our car ride through the hills of SF in search of estate sale-treasures. 

Today I met Claudia, and here is what I learned: 

- She is an 85 year old Parisian woman who met her American husband when he was stationed in France. They got drunk at a party, and she suspects his friend was gay, which is why he wouldn't come to their wedding and always dressed better than everyone else. 

- She has a 12-year old Guatemalan Grandson who was adopted by her daughter. He is ""A little on the pudgy side but very, very cute"". Her daughter lost her job and was going to move to a one-bedroom apartment, but Claudia informed her that ""You don't rescue a child from a third-world country only to make him sleep on the sofa!"" Claudia now pays 3/4 of the rent for a 2-bedroom. 

- She spends her weekends at estate sales finding items to donate to homeless shelters because ""I still plan to live a long time, and I need my stuff, but everyone should do something nice for someone else. That's just the way it is."" 

- She has a Jewish neighbor who is afraid of everything and ""Is more Jewish than any Jewish person I've ever met. She never married, she has more money than God, but the other day I caught her picking up a penny out of the gutter! I told her 'You fucking Jew! You put that penny down and you leave it for someone who needs it! And you wash your hands! They're disgusting!' She didn't leave the penny, but I think she washed her hands."" 

- Before she met her husband she used to sleep with both men and women because ""I don't know how I can say this properly, but you know how when you're really thirsty you drink whatever you can find? Well that's how I was. I was really thirsty. And I was great in bed. But as a woman, if you don't use it you lose it, so I used mine all the time. I'll admit it, I was loose. I was really loose. But I had the body to be loose and I don't regret a thing.""

- She used to make $20 an hour in 1978 working for the Union. She now gets a $900 pension for the rest of her life, as well as her husband's social security. ""I get over $3,000 a month for life. But what does an old woman need with $3,000? I don't drive. My house is paid off. So I give a lot away and I try to have a good time. But I don't smoke those joints of marijuana. I never have, if you can believe that. I like to have a clear head."" 

- On the gay community: ""In France we don't worry about the same silly things Americans worry about. If you're gay, we don't care ... be gay! Plus, if I were a man I'd want to be gay, too. They have much better shoes.""

- When she first moved to the States she cried all the time. ""I hated America. I never understood your culture. It was always my dream to go to South America, where the language, the people and the dancing is all about love and sex. I never wanted to go to North America. But then I met my husband, and I loved him so I came. And nobody would give me a job because my English was bad and because I was not ugly and not pretty, I was just in the middle. But my body was amazing -- I was 5'7"" and 115lbs. Now I'm 5'2"" and 150lbs. Can you believe that? I am five inches shorter and 35 pounds heavier - When I'm naked I look like a chimpanzee! Fortunately nobody sees me naked anymore, but I need to go on a diet. No man wants me like I am right now."" 

- She never made it to South America. ""No ... I never made it. I always wanted to, and now it's too late. But I wanted to go on one of those cruises before I die, but they make you pay the same amount for the room, whether it's just you or you and a friend. Well I don't have anyone to go with me, and that seems silly, so I don't think I'll be going after all.""

- She told me all about the Germans invading Paris, and how her Aunt decided to paint the kitchen the same day. Her Mother, who Claudia called ""The ultimate drama-queen"", balked about the kitchen painting saying, ""Why are you painting! Don't you know the Germans are occupying as we speak?"" To which her Aunt said, ""I am a French woman. They do not care about me. They will leave me alone. I can do what I want to do. And right now I would like to paint my kitchen, so I am going to.""

- She is an avid reader. I told her I saw a 1st Edition of Mein Kampf at a place not long ago, and that I wanted to read it for historical reasons, to which she said, ""I have it. I have a 1st Edition of Mein Kampf. But I'll tell you, Hitler was an awful writer. Just awful. It's full of rambling sentences and those long, German names. You know how Germans can have names that are way too long and full of consonants? Yeah, that's what the book is. Just a bunch of terribly strung together consonants.""

- On men: ""Men are supposed to read dirty magazines. My mother used to go into my brother's room and throw away his dirty magazines. That's just not right. Men have to look at such things, otherwise us women have a higher sex drive and they can't keep up. You know, my Dad was a handsome man and a womanizer. My mother was beautiful, too, but she bitched all the time. It doesn't matter how beautiful a woman is, if she nags all the time she becomes ugly. My Mother was ugly.""

- On her fight with an estate sale cashier who tried to charge her $2 for an item on the $0.50 table ""Look at this face, Sir, (circles face with hand), because this is the last time you will see it for a very long time. You are a thief and a fraud. Good day.""

- And finally, she told me men are babies. ""They're all babies. Every one of them. I once asked my husband, 'Which would you rather clean, the drapes or the floors?"" Well I was 5'7"" and he was 6'2"", and he looked at me and said, 'If I wanted to clean floor I would have married an American woman'. Can you believe that? I was so mad I could have slit his throat open right then! But I didn't. But you know what? I outlived him. I won.""

Today I met Claudia, the 83-year old Parisian woman who hates children and old people, who gives monthly to feed the homeless, who was loose in her younger years, who ""Had lots and lots of sex partners"", and who eagerly jumped into a strangers car to have an adventure.* /backstory
