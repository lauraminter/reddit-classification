Forgive me if this is kind of random, but I'm not sure where else to ask -- my little sister lives in Portland and, long story short, needs help with a haircut.

She's been really depressed lately and today, decided that changing her hair would help with that -- but (in her words) she totally butchered it.  I think it looks cute, but idk ... she doesn't want to leave the house now.  

Point is, she needs a haircut ASAP and isn't getting enough hours at work to afford a professional one right now.  Normally I would give her some $ to go get her hair done, but I'm moving apartments this week and am low on cash too.  

Is there anyone in Portland who likes cutting hair, perhaps does it casually and for fun, who would be willing to meet up with her and give it a spin?  She lives in NE Portland, if I'm correct.  She has a car too though and can likely come to you if that's easier.

I would be able to PayPal/Venmo you some money as a small incentive, if you'd like.  I have tons of friends who love doing hair on the side and do a damn good job at it too, but unfortunately they're down here in Oakland, and I don't know many people in Portland these days.

Thanks in advance y'all!  Enjoy that sunshine. :)

I sent thier general manager a couple of emails listing the problems, and I never heard back from him.  

Based on all that, can we cancel the contract?  or can they, as they threatened to, take legal action against us for not honoring it?

So far, I filed a complant with the Better Business Bureau, and they haven't respond to them either.

Everyone should be going here.

It's a walk-in clinic; no appointments necessary. ""Oh no, I don't want to wait in line behind a bunch of people on my day off!"" you might be saying. Don't worry, that doesn't happen. I've been there 6 times and never once waited more than 15-20 minutes. Several friends have also gone there and reported similarly. I go mid-week and have never had a problem.

It is a modest office, with a single vet - Dr. Behrends. There is nothing fancy about this place, and you might be mistaken to believe that the antiquated appearance reflects the level of care. This could not be further from the truth; I have actually never met a vet I liked more than Dr. Behrends. He is thorough, competent, kind and dedicated. 

Today I brought in both a cat and a dog. My bill, including 2 months of Trifexis and a bottle of antibiotics was $143. He didn't charge me for even seeing my dog. The last time I brought the dog in, he only charged me for half of a visit ($42!) because it was a return trip for an ongoing problem. He remembers my name when I come in, and he remembers my animals. He doesn't nickel and dime on minor office tests. And he genuinely cares. 

I have three cats and three dogs and I wouldn't know what to do without this place. They make it affordable for me to care for the older animals I've adopted (they all have health issues). 

I've been to Laurelhurst Vet, Dove Lewis, and VCA. None of them compare in treatment or cost to Montavilla. I wish I had learned about this office years ago; it would have saved me literally thousands of dollars. 

The only minor caveat I could mention is that the hours for walk-ins are a little weird. Presumably this is because they have to leave scheduled times for things like surgical procedures. No big deal.

9 AM - 12 PM, 2 PM - 5 PM
