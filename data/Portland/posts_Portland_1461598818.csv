So I was a little disappointed in myself that come Friday I had yet to eat a single slice. So I finally got on my bike and decided to try as many slices as I could in my area. Then I tried a few more the next day, and a few more the day after that. I ate nothing but pizza for three days straight and I regret nothing, except wishing I'd done it sooner so you all could benefit from these reviews more. Eh, well, here's how they ranked anyway. 

* [Atlas Pizza's Whiskey-Soaked Smoked Brisket](http://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873679/atlas-pizza-1000.jpg) 

It's amusing to me that the first pizza I tried ended up being the best. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I half-heartedly received my slice, but I think more than any other pizza this hit all the flavors on the tongue. It was sweet and tangy and savory in just the right combination. I wish I had more than one. 

* [Bella Faccia's She Bangs](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873684/bella-faccia-1000.jpg)

This was a close second. When my friend Matt told me there was a mustard-based pizza on offer, I had to venture to NE to give it a shot. The caramelized onions, pork sausage, and feta add the perfect combination of ever so slightly sweet and savory, with a little bit of tang from that mustard. I'm excited to hear it may be sticking around on their menu; I'll gladly come back for more. 


* [Blackbird Pizza's The Reubenesque](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873686/blackbird-1-1000.jpg)

The Reuben is one of my favorite sandwiches, and I was interested to try those same ingredients on a pizza and was not disappointed. I will very probably put sauerkraut on my pizza again in the future. As an aside, Blackbird got the most love from friends when I mentioned my travels. 

* [Hammy's The Breakkie](http://imgur.com/bBXQatO)

Hammy's slices were easily and by far the best bang for your buck. These were the only slices I couldn't eat on the spot, and snacked on throughout the night. These were focaccia-style slices that were more bread than anything, but still had a nice balance of cheese and sauce and other ingredients. The Breakkie was the better of the two for one obvious reason: bacon. 

* [Baby Doll's The Gavone](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873682/baby-doll-ad-1000.jpg)

Baby Doll is my favorite slice in town, period. It's where I go when I want a pure, unadulterated slice of New York-style cheese pizza and where I recommend anyone go to do the same. Travis is a purist (he refuses to put pineapple on his pies) which is why I was surprised to see his wonky penne pasta creation. It wasn't bad, but I'll stick to the tried and true. 

* [Via Chicago's Stuffed Spinach Pie](http://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17878501/viachicago-1000.jpg)

This was the slice I was most looking forward to based on the picture alone. I was a little disappointed that my slice was considerably smaller than I was expecting, but for $2 plus tip it's still a bargain. I could debate the merits of whether Chicago-style can even be considered pizza, but whatever it was I ate was pretty tasty. 

* [Hammy's The Athena](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873701/hammys-the-athena-1000.jpg)

The lesser of Hammy's two options. I've always been a proponent of veggie over meat pizza toppings, long before I limited my meat intake to special occasions, but there just weren't enough on this slice to even out the thick breading. That said, eating both at the same time made for a lovely balance of flavors. 

* [SFNY's Spanish Bomb](http://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17878499/straight-from-new-york-2-1000.jpg)

The strength of this pizza was despite, and not because of, its special ingredients. SFNY makes a decent pizza, and the crust and cheese on this were as serviceable as always, but I didn't find the romesco sauce added anything remarkable to it. 

* [Roman Candle's Loaded Baked Potato](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873716/roman-candle-2-1000.jpg)

This slice stretched the definition of pizza. It was definitely more of a focaccia bread, but unlike Hammy's offerings there was little pizza flavor involved. That's not to say it was bad; I enjoyed the melding of sour cream and baked potato. It just wasn't pizza. 

* [Pizzicato's Mama's Little Secret](http://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873714/pizzicato-1000.jpg)

The arugula I thought more detracted than added to the slice. The peppers worked better, giving it a bit of spice. I'll admit that I was in a hurry to get to my next destination, and this pizza arrived to me piping hot, so I wasn't in the best position to enjoy it.

* [Scottie's Stuffed Crust](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873720/scotties-1000.jpg)

The greasiest, floppiest slice of the bunch, as evidenced from the grease stains on my shirt and jacket afterwards. The crust was barely there, mostly saved for the crust, which was okay but didn't make up for an otherwise unremarkable cheese slice. 


* [Hot Lips' Glazed &amp; Confused](http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/17873703/hot-lips-2-1000.jpg)

Far and away the worst slice I tried; to the point where I had to force myself to finish it and barely managed. The Mercury had warned that this slice wouldn't be for everyone due to the cilantro, but I've no problems with cilantro itself. The sauce was weird, the brocoli rabe was weird, everything was just off. The saddest part is that this seems to the only other slice mentioned as possibly sticking around.

Long story:  About 5 months ago I moved to SE portland from an apartment with included utilities. Now they aren't, so all the bills are in my name and work the way I've come to expect bills work, with the exception of water. I was told they would send me a bill for 3 months usage, which eventually came and my brother paid. I was out of town and didn't look at it or anything, he just texted me that he paid it. Then last month some random woman was out in the driveway with the cover pulled off the water meter looking into the little vault tapping on her phone. I asked what was up and she said she was checking the water meter. I was on the way out and she didn't seem that shady so I just locked up and took off.

  So friday I get a water bill. Not from the city, but from some random website-less LLC based in Vancouver with a phone number that just goes to some woman's personal cell phone which she hasn't answered all weekend. It's also barely even a bill, it's non-itemized one line item form with ""water"" billed for the last 3 months to our physical address for around $200. 

Obviously that seems shady as fuck. I haven't received any phone calls, letters, or contact from anyone but her. She cashed the check my brother sent her (no idea why he did that but whatever), and when I called the City on friday they weren't very helpful.

The end of this month will be the 10th anniversary of my ETS.  Turns out I miss you fuckers.

I suck at meeting people, so I ~~set up an ambush~~ created a sub with the intent of it being a low-key, low-drama place where Portland-area veterans can congregate.  We'll see what happens from there, but I can imagine the usual discussion of veterans issues, plus if enough people join, it might serve as a way for people to meet friends and activity partners.

BBQ!  Shoot!  Ride!  Pickup sports!  Bitch about the VA! Beer! Hike! Bike! Give back! Play games!  Use lots of acronyms and initialisms!  Don't kill yourself!  Or whatever you're into.

I'm not going to check your DD214 or anything, but it's a private sub and it is 18+.  PM me with a little bit about your service if you want in.  Currently serving predditors are allowed. Yes, Nasty Girls, I'm talking to you.  Obviously I won't be able to tell whether or not any of you are being truthful about anything anyone says they've done, their skill at gorilla warfare, etc., so I'm going with the honor system, and valor thieves can fuck off.  You know in your tiny heart who you are.

All eras of service welcome, all branches of service welcome, all races/genders/creeds blah blah, all green, all equally worthless, and so on.  If you were an officer, you can come in *I guess.* If you were a POG, I have to let you in, otherwise I'd be disqualifying like 9/10ths of the pool.  I will do flutter kicks while I self-flagellate with my blue cord later.

Anyhow, yeah.  I'll probably need help.  But there it is.

The local bike culture around here seems to be ""we own the road; fuck you."" I'm writing to report a particularly egregious example of this I witnessed not ten minutes ago.

I was driving home. I was pulling up to a two-way stop, stop sign controlling my direction (meaning I had to stop, cross traffic had right of way), and I was doing so. I noticed, as I pulled up to the intersection, two little girls, maybe 10-12 years of age, getting ready to cross the intersection in front of me. I settled in to wait for them to finish.

They never crossed. They stepped out... and this asshole on a bicycle just *blasted* through that stop sign. The girls had to literally jump back on to the curb to avoid being run over by this guy. They had right of way, both in the sense that they got there first, and in the sense that he had a stop sign and they did not, and in the sense that they are *fucking pedestrians*, and children, to boot.

I wouldn't be quite so angry about this if I didn't see things like this all the time. Here's another example. One night I was on my bike. It was dark. I came up on a two-way stop, this time with the stop signs regulating perpendicular traffic (meaning I had right-of-way). However, because I am not an idiot with a death wish, I slowed down to ensure the safety of the crossing, anyway. It is a good thing I did, because another bicyclist, once again, blasted through his stop sign, and if my estimation is correct he passed exactly through the spot I would have been if I actually trusted people to observe traffic laws... which is to say, there would have been a bicycle-on-bicycle collision.
