We began talking about their position and how they justify working for a corrupt organization. Their response was “not all cops are good people just like not all teachers are good teachers.” Within their position they believe that they are fighting two forces, crimes within the public and crimes within their own house. (One apparently used to work in internal affairs). 


We then discussed the meaning behind the curfew witch was similar to the reasoning put in place in Minneapolis. To my response I asked why don’t you take the same concept and leave your job as a “good cops” to leave the bad ones exposed?

For the last few nights, we've seen both peaceful marches and destructive marches, just like every other major city in America.  The news has, unsurprisingly, highlighted the destructive ones over and over.  We've been repeatedly told that the violence is coming from Antifa, that they're hijacking this moment for black people and making it about themselves.  I just wanted to clear up some of this with some history.

&amp;#x200B;

First, you are probably conflating Antifa with various leftist people, some of which operate under the ideology that it isn't immoral to smash inanimate objects.  Now I'm not going to dive into whether or not that is okay, or whether or not it is productive, and I think my views on it might actually surprise you.  But I do  want to tell you that Antifa isn't  an organization with a leader or even some kind of club outside shared interest of really really disliking nazis.  They aren't responsible for the destruction of property because they don't have an organization.  So when the president wants to add Antifa to the list of terrorist organizations, that should give you some pause to try to figure out who he is targeting.

*“The U.S. doesn’t have a list of domestic terrorist groups,” said  Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on  Extremism. “Antifa is not a coherent group or organization, so how that  is being defined — I’m mostly unsure about what the intent there is, and  how that’s being used.”*

&amp;#x200B;

So why are both parties pushing the ""Antifa is hijacking the protests"" narrative?  Well, lets look back at another riot to find out.    In 1965 an African-American motorist was pulled over in Watts neighborhood of LA for reckless driving, and a cop hurt a pregnant woman.  Six days following that there were riots that totaled in $40,000,000 in damages in the Watts neighborhood.  Throughout the entire crisis, public officials claimed that  outside agitators were the ones causing the destruction and theft of property.  They blamed communists from out of state.  Why?  Because it helped quell the rioting.  Because it created infighting.  Because when Joe Schmoe watching the riots on the news sees pictures of looting, and hears that it isn't the black folks doing it, he doesn't think the black folks are very angry.  Because it convinced some black people that the white people standing side by side with them weren't allies, and it convinced some white people that other white people weren't allies as well.  Because it divided them, discouraged them, and ultimately made the rest of country discount the rage of African Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

And in the end, there were official reports refuting the presence of outside agitators.

&amp;#x200B;

If you look up the term outside agitators, you'll find its history.  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside\_agitators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_agitators)

If you look up the Watts Riot, you'll know this very narrative playing out. [http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts\_riots/?Welcome](http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome)

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks that not everyone protests in the way I like to protest.  It sucks that the media is concentrating on shops burning instead of police kicking people who are kneeling, flashbanging peaceful protests, and pepperspraying random people on the street.  It also sucks that some people are throwing water bottles and breaking windows, but you have to understand that if you signal boost that narrative you help discredit the entire movement much more than the dumbasses breaking windows.

&amp;#x200B;

So please remember, the destruction of property is infantessimal to the physical violence of our police, especially since the most grieved party in the destruction of property is those who can afford it.

If you think that police imposing physical harm on citizens is an appropriate response to being out past their bedtime, shut the fuck up. Police are in place to arrest people so that they can be tried for their crimes. They aren’t there to live out some judge dredd fantasy about being the judge jury and executioner. Beating people in New York is a crime. Shooting tear gas through people’s front doors for no real reason in Minneapolis is a crime.

I thought it was important to hop on because this pissed me off so much.

I was at the protests last night, and what was shown in that other video posted here happened. After the main protest bits ended, we were trying to get back to our car and were walking with a big group of people. All of a sudden, (what felt like, at least) an enormous number of police cars and vehicles with riot officers on the side started speeding wildly up and down every street in every direction, taking random turns, throwing tear gas grenades off/out of their cars at any people they saw. I was in a huge group absolutely booking it back and forth trying to escape, but being constantly cut off by tear gas. It was 100% obvious that they were cutting us off. It felt like they just wanted to gas people. One large-ish group just sat down at the apple store in defeat waiting for them to stop or arrest them or whatever. They flew by on the waterfront, assuring that no one could get out that way. I tried to put out some of the grenades, but wasn't remotely protected and didn't like the feeling of being barrelled down by like five cop cars. I only got away after what felt like twenty minutes of random sprinting and finally crossing an opening before they got there again.

I really tried to count, and my rough guess is that I saw at least 20 tear gas grenades thrown last night, though anxiety and fear could make that wildly inaccurate.


As a side note, it's worth noting that, although I saw a *lot* of shit get broken, it was only ever individuals that immediately got yelled at or pushed back by the rest of the crowd. Anytime someone threw a bottle or whatever at the cops, people would push them back and chant ""peaceful protest"" or ""do not engage"". That stopped being true as chaos started and people started throwing fireworks back in exchange for flash-bangs and tear gas, because everyone else was just running.

And I know it doesn't help, but the experiences of the night made me more sympathetic to everyone, really.

I realized that in a way, there was no escape for the cops. Once such a massive group of people made it to the justice center, I realized people weren't just going to go home on their own. In that way, they couldn't do anything different unless their superiors adopted a policy of stoicism or whatever.

On the other hand, I came to understand being just *pissed the hell off* that there are these people with legal and physical protection that allowed them to do whatever the fuck they want. I was hiding in a parking garage stairway with scared kids, a bike security guard, a homeless guy, just trying not to get seen by this armed force that was putting the city under siege. I've never once felt less safe in my own city.

Idk, these are just thoughts. There’s a better way.

So. Fucking. Close. The crowd was gathered in front of the Justice Center and everything was calm. The cops came down the steps and were talking to a couple people with megaphones, who in turn were talking to the crowd.


Thousands of people were quiet. Everybody wanted to hear what was being said. Someone even handed a megaphone over the fence so that one of the cops could speak to the crowd. It was relaxed enough that cops came out from inside the building to take pictures of the crowd, and several even took off their masks. Eventually a couple black leaders were invited inside the Justice Center to speak with the police. THIS WAS HUGE.


Immediately after the fence was opened to let them in, some ASSHOLE lit a firework and threw it into the crowd. Everybody panicked, and the energy completely changed. It wasn't peaceful anymore. The cops tried to corral people back into the park in front of the Justice Center but of course it didn't work.


What really sent the cops over the edge were more fireworks. They were being thrown at the police on the street and the ones watching from the Justice Center. The officer over the loudspeaker must've told the crowd to move something like 10 or 15 times, and once the fireworks started flying, so did the teargas.


I'm SICK and TIRED of the progress of these PEACEFUL protests being ruined by a small group of instigators. The first night I went out, I just watched when people smashed windows.
