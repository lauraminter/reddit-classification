Boyfriend passed out in bed, but first he took the pizza out and turned oven off. My world is at peace. Thank you everyone for your advice! I called the non emergency dispatch but couldn't get through the voice recording maze  
  
  ________________
GAH! I feel silly doing this but I don't know if I should just call 911. Boyfriend and I are long distance, he's in Portland near hilsboro. He watched th super bowl alone at this apartment and sounded like he had 3-4 heavy beers (8%) without eating lunch. He's not a huge guy, maybe 140lbs. And then he started drinking whisky and coke around 7ish. He was responsive, we had talked on the phone and texting a bit after and all of a sudden he took a turn for the worse. I know he put a pizza in the oven before I stopped hearing from him. But basically I don't know if he passed out with the oven on or puked in the bathroom and fell asleep on the floor. This is his last texts to me.

I am moving to Washington, D.C. in a couple of weeks for a great job opportunity. I am familiar with the area as my wife was born and raised there, but only superficially so. We are both concerned that, as people who really love Portland (for various typical reasons like awesome access to nature, laid back people, great cheap food, etc.), we aren't going to love it there. 

My hope is that my wife's views on D.C., which were formed as a teenager growing up in Northern Virginia, might be a little outdated. She views it as a nebulous combination of boring/douchey/non-artistic people. I can't help but think that the city has changed a lot in recent years, and that it will have most of the amenities now associated with almost all decent sized cities (coffee shops, restaurants, walkable grocery stores, etc.) in addition to its fair share of cool, regular people. 

Can anyone that has lived both there and here in Portland recently weigh in on whether or not we might be able to look at D.C. as more than just a place to make some money over the next few years?

I am just your average lab working nerd that games online when home or read comics and stuff. The other roommate is big on working on bikes, never usually uses the kitchen and I barely see him. Plus he is moving into the basement so he will be seen less. 

The house is nice with problems that comes with an old house. Has a gated backyard that with some work someone can have a garden.  Lastly it has a small kitchen and not a lot of room for a lot of pots for non meat eaters. Plus some animals are way to tasty to not eat.
