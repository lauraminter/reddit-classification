It is an issue for a number of reasons:

**1:** Most dogs do not have specific training and some don’t even have the necessary obedience to be safe.  There have been instances where service dogs have been attacked by non-service dogs.  Or even just general altercations such as the issue not too long ago of the Pomeranian who died on the PSU tram (article link: http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/09/streetcar_dog_attack_pit_bull.html).

**2:** It is a nuisance for those with allergies who might experience symptoms from being in close quarters with an animal.  I saw a lady bring a husky into a small pharmacy- I mean, seriously.  That is where people are often picking up their meds!

**3:** It is becoming inappropriate.  I have seen dogs try to lift their legs on produce stands at grocery stores.  What is unfortunate is the proprietors are nervous to do anything because of potential legal ramifications.    However, general public, there is nothing barring us from saying something.  And if we don’t, I would like to pose the question of “who will?”

**4:** It is not allowed.  Plain and simple.  Non- Service dogs, even ESA are not legally given the same public access as service dogs.  A service dog is trained to perform a specific task.  This is an important designation in identifying service from non-service dogs.  Also, the reality of the situation is that many people who claim to have an ESA certification, do not actually have the training or certification to make that allegation valid.  

So, story time: I confronted a lady on the MAX today and yeah, she got really mad.  She had with her a chihuahua mix and I asked her ""is that a service dog?""  She puffed up a bit and said yes. So, I asked ""oh, what service is it trained to do?""  

""It is an emotional support animal,” she replied.

So I explained that service dogs and ESA dogs have different rights in terms of public access
that service dogs do indeed have public access, but the designation ESA is more applicable to housing, 
ie if you want to live in an apartment that doesn't have a pet policy, that can be allowed. But according to regulations, and contrary to popular belief now that lines keep getting blurred, ESA dogs are not allowed in restaurants, libraries, and grocery stores, and they must be crated on public transportation. She got huffy and asked me if I was with trimet.  I said no, but I was a concerned citizen.  Then she was like “well, if you're not with trimet, I don't think you should be in my business.""
Then, rather pricelessly the guy on the max behind me chimed in and said, “it isn't you're business because you are not the only one on this MAX.”  The lady and her dog got off on the next stop.  The guy who chimed in thanked me for saying something.  And another gentleman warned me that people don’t like being told if they are doing something wrong.  I thanked the gentleman who backed me up, and told the other gentleman, that I made it a priority to explain things politely, but it is a public issue.  So yeah, food for thought today and maybe think about saying something next time you see a malamute in a grocery store (sorry about the bad pun).  

For more information on the laws that define the distinction and access of Service Dogs and ESA please see the following links:
https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet
and
http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/psychiatric-service-dogs-emotional-support-animals-access-public-places-other-settings.ht

*“Many individuals—both with and without disabilities—derive emotional support and comfort from dogs and other animals that are not specially trained to perform specific tasks directly related to a psychiatric disability.
The ADA considers such “emotional support animals” to be distinct from psychiatric service dogs, and treats them differently. The ADA does not grant emotional support dog owners the same right of access to public places that it gives to individuals who use psychiatric service dogs. That means that under the ADA, a movie theater, for example, must allow psychiatric service dogs to accompany their owners into the movie auditorium but can refuse to admit individuals with emotional support dogs.”*

Trimet’s code and policy (see section O and 28.15, section 6):
http://trimet.org/pdfs/code/TriMet_Code_Chapter_28.pdf

*“Service Animal” means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability… The crime deterrent effects of an animal’s presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition.*


**TL;DR: ESA dogs do not have the same public access as service dogs.**

We made changes based on that feedback and  [we're hosting another one this Saturday from 9-6!](https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/149) 
        
**Why should you learn to code:**     
The tech industry is growing very quickly in Portland and just about everywhere else. I've heard numbers like 3 jobs for every developer. Just take a look at any of the monthly job threads and you'll see that they are dominated by tech industry jobs. Even if you find that you don't like writing code you can still become a project manager, iteration manager, analyst, tester, ect. Knowing the basics of how to write code will not only give you a leg up in those positions, but it may help you land a non-technical job at a tech company as working with people who understand that the devs aren't working magic is awesome. 

**What you will learn:**     
This course focuses on Ruby on Rails. During the December course we treated everyone as if they were total beginners, mostly because we were trying to figure things out ourselves. But this time, you'll be split up into groups based on experience. For absolute beginners- you'll figure out how to follow tutorials to build web applications, and depending on your experience you might go home with a better understanding of pair programming, OO, MVC, that bug you could never figure out or anything else you can think of. 

**Who is this course for:**   
Our goal is to help people from non-traditional backgrounds and people from groups underrepresented in the tech industry learn how to code. Our students are parents, career changers, women, PoC, folks with a [low socioeconomic status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status), lgbtqi. If you're not a member of one of those groups, or you're already in the industry, we recommend that you volunteer. If you have a question about this please PM me and we'll figure something out. 

**Additional resources to learn how to program:**     
I think that learning Ruby or Python is a great way to go. Once you learn one language the next is easy. I started with Ruby about four years ago and since I've worked professionally in Objective C, python, Java and some horrendous propriety stuff from the late 90s. Just pick one and stick with that until you feel ready to move on. Everything I post will be Ruby centric. 

https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/ Start here if you've never programmed before. I've gifted the hard copy of this book to multiple friends who have learned to code. If you don't understand a chapter read it again. At one point I had to throw this book down because all of a sudden something made sense and it was exciting! 

http://learncodethehardway.org/ruby/ Core ruby- not only does the author give you great advice he teaches how to find the answers on your own. 

https://www.railstutorial.org/book Ruby on Rails- Michael Hartl takes you through building different projects. Do this at least twice from start to finish. I also recommend this to devs transitioning from other languages to Ruby with or without Rails. 

http://codeoregon.org/ Online courses and meetup groups! 

http://www.meetup.com/Learn-RUBY-PDX/ An awesome meetup groups that goes over some of the resources I already listed and does code problems together. 

http://calagator.org/ Get involved in the local community here- it's never too early to start. I know several people who have gotten jobs based partly on their positive contributions to the local community, if nothing else it helped get their foot in the door. 

**How you can help:**    
We can never have too many volunteers! We also need locations to host future events and sponsors that can provide food, child care or money to pay for either. We are a 503c corporation so any donations are tax deductible. 

**Will you host more?**    
[Yes, watch here.](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-RailsBridge/) 

**Other stuff:**     
The vast majority of our volunteers and sponsors are developers who do not have Computer Science degrees. If you want to learn and are willing to put in the effort we are an entire community of people who are here to help and teach you in a safe space. Please come and please ask questions.

Just like everyone else, I am tired of seeing the homeless, beggars, the mentally ill, and the drug addicts everywhere around the city. Part of the mental fatigue comes from feeling incapable of making a real difference, or feeling guilty that I am seemingly unwilling to put in the effort needed to volunteer and be directly involved.


I never give money directly to beggars, because I do not feel it is likely to improve their situation.  I always think to myself, ""oh, I'll donate to a charity instead"", but that never happens, so I would like to try something new.


The idea is to keep a mental count of every person in need I pass throughout the day. At the end of the day, I'd put some amount of money per person into a fund to donate to a charity that might help them.  Originally I was thinking $1 per person, but then I realized I would go broke just walking from the bus stop to my office... so maybe 10 cents would be a good start.. something that adds up to a dollar or two a day.  It's a mental game to to feel more connected to the individuals, and at least pretend to be helping them directly.


As part of this exercise, I'd like to have a list of effective charities to donate to.  Ones that provide direct benefits to the people, and ideally help them find a path to a better existence. Housing, mental health services, addiction services would all be great, but I don't know where to look to start compiling the list.
