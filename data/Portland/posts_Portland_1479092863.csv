Some of you are at great risk of damaging your own lives in ways you might not be thinking about. 

I say this because WE NEED YOU to remain a free and energetic force for good in this community.

I say this because some of you have people who DEPEND ON YOU. 

Those of you who have children, I am begging you now: do not put yourselves at risk of being absent from their lives for any amount of time. Not for this.

Some people arrested in the rioting are getting minor charges. Some people are risking much more than just a night in jail and an easy court date.

Jail time and community service sentences for misdemeanors, these are not such a big deal. For those of you sitting in the streets, blocking the MAX et cetera, the consequence might be limited to an un-deletable mugshot that keeps you from getting jobs and apartments. Consider also that in this political climate, this is a mugshot that some alt-right jackass could potentially use to ID you. I don't say this to try to ""chill dissent."" Just to point out potential consequences. If these things are concerns to you, be careful how you behave out there.

There are, though, some people risking heavy legal and life-impacting consequences because of their behavior. Those of you doing the property damage and threatening people who ask you not to act that way: does it not occur to you that the cameras all around you have captured a ton of this? You won't just be charged with the crime they arrest you for, you'll eventually be charged with every one that's been recorded over the past week, if anyone feels the need to turn that evidence over to law enforcement.

I see too many of you every night making impulsive decisions, letting the mob do your thinking for you. Letting immediate circumstances and opportunities to make spectacular statements do your thinking for you. Losing your autonomy to the madness of a crowd is not a wise move.

Black bloc: Your security culture is swiss cheese. A weakness that a certain president-elect will thoroughly exploit. I know you're just beginners. The problem for you is, you're so reckless you'll never be anything but beginners. You are easily recognizable, exhibiting all kinds of idiosyncratic ""tells,"" you exercise no caution at all about concealing your identities or associations. I can see everything about you on social media right now. This is our local vanguard of radical resistance? Weak.

You seriously all want to get caught, don't you? Just so you can be seen to be the person who carried out the brave and noble action against a window pane?

Every night I'm seeing that old pathology of protest, that thing where the protesters only offer symbolic resistance (this includes all the bottle throwing and property destruction), where the cops reliably play their ""bad guy"" part, and the protesters defeat and damage no one but themselves.

If an authoritarian administration wants you silenced, it's going to be easy for them. You made it easy for them. You have given yourselves up already. Consider toning it down a little for now and re-thinking everything about whether you have any strategy at all, and what the possible consequences of your actions are going to be for you and your associates and for your loved ones.

To the massive numbers of completely apolitical morons who are just covering your faces with handkerchiefs and going around throwing bricks, breaking everything, menacing regular people, just for kicks...forget it, I'm not warning you any more, I'm turning over my video recordings to police if you do this again tonight. You people deserve all the consequences that law enforcement is going to give you. 

As for the people who are standing around doing nothing while witnessing these kinds of sociopaths commit these crimes: if you're okay with this behavior, you're not the good people I thought you might be. Go home if you don't have the heart to tell these people to stop. You don't have to agree with the rally organizers that ""everyone expresses their rage differently"" and that you shouldn't ""police other peoples' free expression"" or whatever. There are limits to what you find acceptable in the behavior of others, and you know it. Don't let the mob's inertia dictate your standards of acceptable conduct. Draw a line where you think the expressions of rage go too far. Will you speak up when people in your demonstration damage corporate property? No? How about when smaller locally owned stores are damaged or looted? Or a store owned by a friend of yours? What about when verbally aggressive political opponents are verbally threatened? When completely random people on the street are accosted, insulted for no discernible reason, and assaulted? Where are your boundaries? At what point will you say ""no, that's not okay, that's counterproductive in multiple ways, that is not what we are here to do""...? Stop allowing these people to hide between you and all the rest of the decent, generous, lovely people out there. Downtown Portland is where I live and where I work, and my life has been threatened several times this week by these fucking dipshits as I try to go about my day and I'm about to lose my cool about this.

Sorry if I burst anyone's bubble. Glad you're having fun out there. I just think some of you ought to be more thoughtful about strategy and consequences.

By the way, I recommend listening to conservative talk radio this week if you get a chance, not because I'm a fan of it, but because it's so fascinating. They've been having a field day with the rioting. Keep an eye on how they use this behavior on our streets to characterize the politics of our city. If you consider yourself a progressive or liberal Portlander, maybe listen in to understand how you and your city might be perceived right now by red state America.

I and a group of friends do a yearly event where we give out items directly to the homeless. In the past we've visited camps, walked around Old Town and setup drop off sites. We are not a religious, political or otherwise affiliated with an organization group. We are a group of bar flies. 

One of our group made an Amazon wishlist:
http://a.co/3nHX3vY

It includes things like toothpaste, tampons, condoms, gloves, toothbrushes, dry shampoo, tent repair.

If you see anything missing, let us know!

If you know of any good clearances at Freddy's, Safeway, Walgreens etc let us know! 

If you have a subscription to a Birchbox, Glossybox and have spare toiletries or make up, let us know! We like to include gifts if we can.

We also need TriMet bus tickets, pillows, sleeping bags, basic camping equipment, scarves, sweaters and coats... We probably wouldn't say no to cash but it's not high on the list since it kind of complicates things for us a bit. Gift cards might help?

We have two drop off sites. One in NW and one in SE. PM for details.

Edit: If you want to join us also drop me a line! We haven't worked out our strategy/route yet (it's often dependent on weather and if the camps have had a clear out) but we'll keep you apprised and we're happy to have the help. There's also beer at the end of the line :)

Edit2: If you see cheaper versions of things like dry shampoo, let me know. I have NO idea why it's so expensive.

Thank you!

I had a guy knock on my door asking about an old jeep I have in the driveway, wanted to know if I'd sell it. So I go out and show him around, I was thinking of selling it anyway. He says he'll think about it and call me back later, gets my number (but doesn't give his &lt;-- this is flag #1) and goes to leave. Then he asks about my other car that has some body damage and scratches. Its a 2005 midrange acura, not luxury by todays standards, but a very nice car. He offers to repair the scratches with a method he's got, he's a mechanic thats trying to start his own mobile auto body repair business.


Like a fool, i agree and he gets to work cleaning and rubbing the scratches with this buffing solution he's got. An hour later he says its done, just to leave the wax on for a few hours before buffing it off. We agree to $200 for his work which is great for me because that work would be $1000 at the shop. I don't have the cash so he suggests he follows me to a cash machine. I'm seriously doubting this situation by now but I kind of want to get him away from my wife and kids so I agree and we go. I go in for the atm and do a google while I'm there to see yep, I've been scammed. I go back out and tell him I'll have to pay him after I see how it turns out since I can't tell yet how it turned out.


He gets a little agitated and starts to insist I pay him so he can replace the materials before he returns to the shop so they don't know he's working on the side.

A non-profit of some sort will be taking it over and they do drug/alcohol rehabilitation and want to cater this place to people with health problems.  They said that next week is the last time you can go there as a member of the public.  

Separately I was surprised by a number of policy changes there, including it closing to the public at 5pm and their rates increased.  It used to be 3 hours for $25 and now its 2 hours for $40.  A russian I spoke to there said that this is because too many people went there for the sauna and so they had to make changes to discourage visitors.  So you won't be to check in to use the pool after 3pm.  He also said the owner has been trying to sell it for 5 years and that they finally paid his asking price.  

For me this is kind of bittersweet.  I would like to go there more in the future but the rates are now pretty expensive.

Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” 

Fear is literally that powerless. Do not focus on what has gone wrong, but focus on the infinite possibilities that still remain. Each of us is infinitely capable of compassion, overcoming disagreement, and resolving problems. We have as a people solved much bigger problems than we face today. We can do it again.

Many are preaching fear - that there is no hope.  This makes you easy to control.

I got off Facebook on Wednesday. I check the news once a day and then turn it off. I then spend my time thinking of ways to help others. 

I called a minority friend to see how he was doing with all this. I bought the drink of the guy at 7-11 behind me. I checked with local services I could volunteer at.

Please think of the great things each one of you can do to make our home a great place that is not ruled by fear and hate. I have faith in you all!

I do this because they have a 9 year old girl and a six year old boy, and I usually don't bother getting much if anything for the parents.

I don't want to buy stuff and have it thrown out if it's deemed useless.  I usually stick with Lego, but am hoping to get other ideas.

I live in Canada so I try and order online to lessen the shipping cost, but there's only so many places that offer gift wrapping online, and amazon.com gets kinda boring after so many years.

I believe they already have a family membership to the childrens museum, and possibly others.  They are dairy, gluten and a few other things free so I hesitate to buy anything food related.

Does anyone have any unique local to Portland suggestions?",False,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Gifts for partially estranged family members,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/5ckzxo/gifts_for_partially_estranged_family_members/,,,,,,,
