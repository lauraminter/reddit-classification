""My daughter usually gets up earliest and goes out to feed them. This  morning, that was about 7:00 am. She discovered that both gates leading  to the street were wide open, and one of the goats was missing - but  the other two were still around.  This, by itself is highly unusual.  Both gates were definitely closed at 11pm when we took the dog out  before bedtime. Zygoat, the girl goat, has never run off - none of them  ever have. If they ever get out of the fenced area, they just wander to  the neighbor's shrubbery and start chowing down - they NEVER run far.

We immediately scoured the surrounding blocks - but I had a hunch this  was not an accident.  We have had drunken fools do pranks before and  come in the yard at 2am, and we did worry about someone actually  stealing them at first (especially when they were babies), but we've had  them 5 1/2 years without a major incident - but I had a pit in my  stomach about this one.

After an hour of searching, I came back  home and created the URGENT - STOLEN GOAT post.  And as much as I  dislike social media sometimes, this time it was a godsend.  Many of our  friends shared it on their pages. And within 2 hours, word had spread  across town, and someone had just seen a post about a white goat roaming  out near Kelley Point Park - 10 miles from our house.

My  daughter and I raced up there and found her, exactly where she'd been  seen a half hour earlier.  She was lying down on a driveway in front of  an industrial park - way the hell away from where anyone lives.  She was  very scared, and didn't want to move.  I noticed she had some injuries  to her back feet - a bit blood here and there, but didn't seem too  major. I was hoping she might just need some stitches.

At this  point, my phone is blowing up every minute with people alerting me to  the goat sighting, so I quickly updated the status to let friends and  family know she had been found.  She still didn't want to move, and  wouldn't put any weight on the leg that was the bloodiest, so I picked  her up and carried her to the car, and immediately called my vet and  sent him pics of her injuries.

It turns out her  injuries were much more extensive than I knew.  Upon closer examination,  she had a fractured leg, multiple cuts and abrasions on ALL FOUR of her  legs - the vet said it looked like she had been hog tied with rope.

I have absolutely no idea how she got free, or if this person let her  go, or what the hell they were doing at an industrial park - no idea  about anything - except that someone came into my yard between 11pm and  7am, carried away my pet goat and abused her. Were they planning to keep  her as a pet? Get milk from her? Butcher her for meat? I have no idea,  but I also have no other better explanation.

She's doing ok now -  we have a temporary support bandage on, pain meds administered, and my  awesome vet will be coming back tomorrow to do a full splint which will  hopefully allow her to heal in 6-8 weeks.

I really didn't think  we were at that point in societal breakdown yet - we still have food,  power, water - even the internet FFS, but maybe some people are more  desperate than I know.

(My apologies if you walked by the house today and asked about Zygoat  and I didn't feel up for sharing the full story - I have been literally  sick to my stomach all day and holding back my pain and rage at this  ordeal, and I couldn't say ""everything's fine"", and I also couldn't get  into this full story...)

But that's the full story.

We  had called the police earlier when she was just missing, but I will call  back tomorrow and escalate this to a case of animal abuse.

I am a furloughed Server who is trying to make ends meet. I posted about willing to work on anyone's cars or trucks in the Portland area about a week ago! 

I had quite a good response to my post last week about a mobile mechanic! I was able to do a brake job and replace an alternator. Unfortunately I wasn't able to take care of everyone who has responded to my post. I was in the process of moving last weekend/week so it was a little tough! 

I am looking for more work though! I have reached out to as many as I could on the last post. 

If you need anything done to your car or truck, let me know! I have over 15 years of experience with various cars and trucks. I have my own tools(lots of specialty tools too.) If you inquire, I will absolutely respond to you! 

I am free this whole week/weekend for service. Whether it's an oil change, a brake job, or something more in-depth! I can give you a price. I can give you a quote with parts and labor or if you provide parts, just labor. No job is too small or large!

Long story short, my wife &amp; I finally made the jump from Comcast to CenturyLink last month. (Pro tip: If Comcast is trying to prevent you from leaving, or otherwise jerking your chain, threaten to go on social media. They change their tune reeeeeeeeeeal fast.) I figured I'd post here about the experience.

tl;dr - Install service is a crapshoot, fiber is sweeeeeeeeet.

Long story short, the first guy couldn't do the install when he came out. It was our fault. He gave us his boss's email address and told us to get in touch once everything was squared away. He seemed pretty competent overall. Alas, as with many things CL, actual followthrough sucked. His boss never emailed us, and he didn't respond to a text we sent. My wife ended up spending hours on the phone with CL before we finally got a second install set up. (Some of it was undoubtedly related to COVID-19 but some of it was the usual crappy CL customer service.)

The second tech seemed kinda clueless. He was nice, just a bit aloof. Once everything was installed and confirmed to work, he took off before epoxying the hole he had drilled or putting a plate over the cable in the house. Whoops! Thankfully, he came back to get a tool he left behind. We caught him and asked him to epoxy the hole and install the plate. He did, and he was nice about it. So, everything did get squared away in the end. Just be sure to look over everything before your tech leaves.

Regarding the service itself, believe the hype, although you may have to apply a little elbow grease in order to get the full benefit. For one thing, I immediately ditched the crappy Zyxel router that the guy gave me. I plugged in my router and followed [these directions](https://dougrathbone.com/blog/2018/03/31/configuring-a-thirdparty-asus-rtac3200-router-to-directly-connect-to-a-centurylink-gigabit-gpon-service) to get it to talk to the ONT (i.e., use PPPoE creds + VLAN ID). The tech did give the creds to me, and everything worked on the first shot. (Side note: The username, despite what the link says, will be *lastnamefirstname@centurylink.net*. If you want to be sure before punching them in, first log into the Zyxel router and get your username from there.) For the record, I use a recent Asus router and [Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/download) firmware. Everything worked like a charm out of the box.

Performance? Frankly, based on my use cases, I see no reason to stick with Comcast if you have a choice. Download speeds are roughly the same, although it seems like CL is a bit faster when I've been transferring large files. Upload speed is a totally different story. It's just as good as CL's download speeds, whereas Comcast's UL speeds, while still the best of non-fiber options (40 Mb/s), is comparably laughable. I don't know if Comcast will ever be able to compete in this regard without rolling out their own fiber first. (I know they offered 2 Gb fiber in extremely limited areas. I don't know if they still do. $300/mth is a lot to ask.) If you work from home and have to deal with large files, this is a no brainer. In real world scenarios, I've seen both DL and UL max out at ~850 Mbps.

Needless to say, you have to use a wired connection in order to get the full benefit. I do, although my wireless devices have gotten great speeds too.

As many people know, there's no data cap (although Comcast has supposedly turned it off 'til at least June 1 or thereabouts). If that matters to you, once again, this is a no brainer.

Finally, on a quasi-related note, I have a co-worker who has [Wave](https://residential.wavebroadband.com/) fiber service. He says it works great but doesn't know much beyond that and the price ($80/mth). From what I've gathered, it looks like they bought out Frontier's fiber service but haven't done much expansion beyond that and some large apartment buildings. If you can get Wave, definitely look into using them. If not, cross your fingers and hope that they can build it out some more sooner or later.

I hope this helps somebody!

I'm a caregiver, so not one of the heroic Doctors and Nurses, but people rely on me. I loaded up all the healthy meals I had prepared at home and was on my way. I helped someone who is paralyzed get out of bed, shower and get ready for their day. I left to care for a 91 year old who asked me to stop at the TJ's near Holgate - there was a line all the way around the building and I didn't have time. As I left, my heart sank when I saw people leaving with more bags than could fit in their grocery cart, but at least half of the people were wearing something on their face. I dropped the meals, tidied the house, did the laundry and most importantly - talked for an hour or more. Missing human interaction is hard for everyone, but especially for a widower who can't go to church. I dropped a box of supplies to a young couple who are expecting. I was a little bit relieved that they were resting because I'm just always afraid that I'm one of those ""silent carriers"" I keep reading about. I'm in my 50's, so I know it's unlikely, but still... Lastly, I stopped at the Albertson's on Murray south of Scholls Ferry. I had dug my facemask out of my old Burning Man supplies. A little dusty, but better than nothing. I put on my gloves, grabbed my list and marched inside. The store was packed. Groups of 4 or 5 people shopping together. I only saw two other people with masks. More than once I waited my turn to head down an aisle and as I was making my selection had an impatient person push up to me and come within inches. I went to the self check-out and noticed that the one clerk in the store with a mask was wearing it around his neck. As I was leaving with the groceries I need to make meals for all these people, I passed two young men. One of them began to cough and I visibly recoiled. The both started laughing. That was the last straw - I sat in my car and cried for awhile. In a few days I will do it all again. I know I'm not alone, and I know I'm so lucky to have an income and I'm still healthy but dang, I can't wait until this is over.",True,False,False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,150927,public,self,I had to sit in my car and cry for awhile...,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/fvj5xm/i_had_to_sit_in_my_car_and_cry_for_awhile/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,
