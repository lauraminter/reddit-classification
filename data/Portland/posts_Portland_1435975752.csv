She said she was embarrassed at her situation and wouldn't elaborate further.   I'm not necessarily the bleeding heart type,  but I can tell when something is *off*.

I told her she could call family and use my phone,  she refused.  I contacted a local women's shelter,  they said they would take her,  came back out to give her the good news and offer her a ride and she said no. 

Now before I get accused of pestering an old lady and told to leave her alone,  here is why it bothers me.   Despite having a ride and a room, she is opting for the dirt where people often piss.   She has jewelry on,  is fairly well put together in terms of neatness,  and given the recent meth junky invasion,  she is extremely likely to get robbed.   It's a little old lady with rings,  sleeping in the dirt.   
I personally think she is in the early stages of dementia,  but I'm not a physician and couldn't get her to divulge too much.   

I called the non-emergency number and tried to get them to do a welfare check,  or see if they had any missing elderly recently.   They said they can't do anything and are too busy to check on her.

Are there any options for this lady?   It's obvious she isn't all there, in my opinion,  considering she refused all help and is in very obvious need of help.   No rational person would be sleeping in piss covered dirt around a bunch of strung out homeless when there is a better option of a real bed.   

Do I just say I tried and call it good?  Or is there a place that can establish if she is mentally capable to decide what's best for her own welfare?   Something doesn't seem right,  and it sounds mean,  but I really don't think she knows what's best for herself. If she was young and well equipped for street,  this wouldn't bother me.   She doesn't have the proper gear for the street,  is an easy target,  and seems quick to frustration when offered help, c when she clearly needs it.  This seems to go a tad beyond a sense of independence and reluctance to seek help.   ",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,"Elderly homeless lady, sleeping in the dirt downtown.

So, my partner has Kaiser insurance. He's been trying to get in to see a psychiatrist for over two months now. Apparently he's on a waitlist. He's also seeing a therapist through Kaiser who only has openings about once a month (doesn't seem very stable to me). He's currently taking a medication for ADD prescribed through his GP and it has been giving him some nasty side effects. It definitely doesn't seem to be the right medication for him. When he speaks to his doctor about this, they tell him that since they aren't a psychiatrist they don't feel comfortable prescribing him something else...see the problem here? 

Like I said, he's been on a waitlist for over two months now. He's called to check back in and reiterate how much he needs to meet with someone, but it obviously hasn't helped. Generally he is stable and this medication is to help improve and organize his life a little bit. He can definitely function without it. 

Honestly my bigger worry here is, how many people who are in dire need of mental health services aren't receiving it because of Kaiser's system? Like, how fucking long is this waitlist!? How many people that are seriously struggling are just somehow sucking it up and living day to day? We know that Portland has a large homeless population. Many of these people are experiencing mental illness. Admittedly I don't know much about OHP but I do know that some of my friends on it receive care through Kaiser. Also, the general population! Obviously many people in our area have Kaiser as their provider...how many people are dealing with this right now? I just don't feel like this is an okay thing. I work in mental health and know how important it is that people are able to receive treatment. Medication and therapy can mean life or death for some people. 

I guess a lot of this post is really just a rant. I don't feel like I can do anything about this as an individual which is obviously frustrating. Does anyone have any experience with this? Has anyone been through the same thing? I guess just any advice or input would be appreciated. I'm not just asking for our situation specifically, just generally wanted to complain about how fucked up this is.

I am a Kansan looking to visit Portland for around three days or so. I have checked the sidebar and googled Portland and it's many attractions, but I had a couple of questions that was not answered directly so I was wondering if you beautiful people could help me out!  
  
I see that Portland has a ton of attractions and such, and I see a couple in specific that I MUST see... such as the museum of science and industry and the parks/nature that Oregon has to offer. One of the things that I am concerned with is: I will be traveling by plane therefore I will have no personal transportation at my disposal. In my state, we rely heavily on cars as the public transportation service is not available in most places. I am inexperienced with public transportation. Will I be okay? Any recommendations? And how much should three days cost me?  
  
Also, one last thing--any personal recommendations? I am especially looking forward to seeing the beautiful scenery that Oregon has to offer. I am also thinking about taking my instrument with me so that I can fully enjoy my experience with what I love. Please let me know!!!
