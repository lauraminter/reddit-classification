Such is the life during a Portland winter. I say that like an authority on the subject, but I have only lived here for four months and have only the word of others to assure me that this is as normal as it gets.

Speaking of normal, I’m depressed. Goes hand in hand with the weather I suppose. I wish there were a ray of sunshine in my life, but I am homeless and the tides of being at the bottom are eroding me at an ever quickening pace. 

Still, I am grateful. If there is anything this experience has taught me it is gratitude for what I do have. I may not have much, but I have a roof over my head and food is plentiful. This shelter is better than the one back in Eugene, and orders of magnitude better than the one in my hometown back in New York. The city is better too. I can be myself without fear of becoming the local spectacle for sporting a beard and a skirt.

Yet, as grateful as I am, one cannot live on bread alone. I need fuel to light a fire inside me. More than anything, I need a mission. Survival is not enough. The days are empty without something to look forward to on the horizon. As it stands now, I am looking towards the end of my life with nothing in between; just sheer boredom of living a hollow life.

I had a mission. It was a good one, too. I wanted to create a movement. I had a plan to use my writing, juggling, and my story to inspire people into an awakened state. As it stands now, the design of society traps people in a matrix-like reality - an illusion based on false assumptions that are perpetuated by the pointy headed cyclops. Some call them the Illuminati, I know them as the network of powerful people wanting to keep their massive share of wealth by maintaining the status quo.

Already, it is safe to assume I have lost a fair number of readers by brining up the name Illuminati. Oh well. When I make a cup of coffee, I use a thin sheet of paper to seperate the things I want from the things I don’t. I want to reach people with open minds warm hearts - my brothers and sisters.

I say this because I see no other choice but to resume my mission. This may seem strange, to bring up the fact that I stopped pursuing this goal and then immediately double back and say I am on the path again. This is because at some point I need to address the elephant in the room.

Doctors say I’m schizoaffective. I may be. But one thing I am certain of is how I’ve been manipulated. I know for a fact that I have the ability to reach people, teach them, and lift them out of their old paradigm and into a new one. I know this because I’ve done it before. This makes me dangerous to those who want to maintain the status quo. 

Thus, I’ve been manipulated to get caught up in the wrong ideas of how to engage people; how to create the movement I desire. I don’t know who is behind it, but I say “The CIA” as a placeholder for the network of individuals who have manipulated me through creating false synchronicities.

You see, I have an alternate way of processing reality. The brain is a pattern recognition device, and it can be tuned to pick up different messages from the white noise that we are constantly bombarded with. With enough manpower, you can consciously condition someone by creating an ongoing set of stimuli to retrain their brain and make them think differently.

I’ve been gang-stalked, cross-talked, and overall deceived by people that entered my life and the result was thinking the way to succeed in my mission was through fame. Moreso, the solution I saw as the quickest avenue of approach to fame was to become infamous first then use the leverage I developed to propel my genuine character into the spotlight. This was fed to me through a series of stimuli that made a lot of sense in the moment but in sight...well…

Let’s just say I failed spectacularly and fell flat on my face as a result. I think that needed to happen. I grew immensely as a result of all my failures and now I am much wiser than I once was. Of course, I’m still flawed, and will continue to be, but the last four months (the last two years even) have been the most transformative period of my life.

Forget fame. I want to teach people the things I’ve learned. The thing is though, you cannot teach wisdom; you can only live a good life and inspire others to seek the truth themselves. Sure, I can say simple things like “free will is a skill” or “our first love is self-love; if the gardener does not take care of themselves, who takes care of the garden?” and they may be axioms of great truth to me, but there is always much lost in translating thoughts from one mind to another. 

This is the communication problem that I sought to solve when I was an education major almost a decade ago. As you can surmise, much has happened in that time and now I sit with a toolbox full of tools and no projects to work on. Where are the students in a world where everyone is certain they know the truth? I only know how I freed myself from addiction, maladaptive behaviors, and lifestyle obsessions of the western world.  I will continue to learn and add tools to my toolbox as I grow and ascend out of poverty.

Until I find a friend to share our collective experiences, I will continue juggling oranges on street corners when I can. Maybe you’ve seen me if you spend time around Pioneer Square or the Saturday Market? I am limited in my ability and willpower to juggle during the rainy season, but I am looking forward to the summer months where I can juggle anywhere, anytime. 

I plan to stay in Portland. From the few places I’ve been, this feels like the place I belong. Despite the low points of my mood (which may as well be a roller coaster), I will continue my mission whenever I am able and at the very least give some joy to the people of the city. You’ve been kind to me, even if we;ve never met, by fostering a culture where I can be me freely. For that, I am grateful.

A swift current of anxiety propelled me from hustle to hustle, and one of my biggest fears was the absence of food. It was especially depressing during the holiday season, when people were shoveling seemingly anything into a cart to stuff under a tree, while I was drawing every bit of magic I could out of dried lentils and $1 day-old donut boxes. I was already familiar with the food pantry on SE Milwaukie, and how it was necessary to arrive before the doors opened if you hoped to be seen before noon; it wasn’t unusual to have to return in the afternoon to walk out with some bags of food, anyway, with the crowd growing increasingly panicked and impatient. Poverty can feel like a full-time job, especially when you factor in the limited transportation options, and doing things that actually earn money. Standing in St. Vincent’s line, and then sitting in that waiting room, truly illuminated the range of hardship throughout Portland. There were people waiting with multiple children, young people who had lost the budgeting game, and working people in various states of shame for being without other options. Despite the perception that every broke person is a junkie, I never saw one there; just a lot of desperate people finding some comfort in the company of others in similar places. 

I had no idea what the experience of poverty was until I fell into it myself, and the many obstacles that can derail the most earnest effort to gather sufficient income. I’m fine now, and I’m grateful for it, but I haven’t forgotten the generous food box that arrived at my door for Thanksgiving and Christmas that year, courtesy of St. Vincent De Paul. The folks sorting the food took pains to make sure every box had the makings of a full meal, and they provided food cards that could be exchanged for turkey, ham, or a vegetarian option. These boxes were a source of joy in an otherwise joyless point in my life, and I can’t emphasize enough how much $20 worth of food matters when you have $2 to your name. 

I’m sharing all of this because those food pantry boxes still exist for Multnomah County residents, and are available to anyone who needs them. All you have to do is call 503-595-2292. This is also a fantastic time to donate food and money. Before living it I’d just give anything from my cupboards to food banks, but now I take a more thoughtful approach. A jar of pasta sauce and some noodles is hitting the jackpot. Cooking oil of any kind exceeds expectations. Vegetables were approached with reverence. 

If you need a box, don’t be ashamed, just call. If you don’t need a box, consider filling one.

I’m planning on calling Portland Bureau of Transportation about this tomorrow, but I’m curious if any of you can point me in the right direction in the mean time.

There’s a one block stretch of road in Southern/SW Portland, on SW Kelly Ave right between SW Gaines and SW Lane St, that does not have any parking signs and is not listed as any particular type of parking zone on PBOT’s parking zone map.

*Processing img zhyep92kkh541...*

This map is based on Vancouver BC's fantastic Sky Train system and Seattle's ongoing Sound Transit Expansion. Here are the additions compared to the current MAX system:

1. All lines: grade separation through the central city with elevated rail and a Steel Bridge replacement. Rail and switching upgrades to support a maximum speed of at least 45mph in between stations wherever possible.
2. Blue Line: extension to Forest Grove and grade separation via railroad style crossings for all intersections such as with the current track between Beaverton and Hillsboro, along with elevated rail where necessary.
3. Red Line: replace WES with an extension to Tigard and Tualatin on dedicated track that would follow roughly the same route. Grade separation with railroad style crossings and elevated rail through Downtown Beaverton and Downtown Tigard.
4. Yellow Line: Extend north to E 4th Plain in Vancouver via the CRC project and along i5 on the Washington side. Grade separate the alignment on N Interstate via railroad style crossings at every intersection. To the south, re-route through the Central Eastside on elevated rail over either MLK, SE 11th, or SE 12th. Extend to SW Portland, Tigard, and Tualatin via a combination of Barber Blvd. and along i5. 
5. Green Line: Extend to Oregon City with a route along i205. Also extend through Downtown to Mongomery Park and the NW Industrial District via a route along i405 and elevated rail above NW Vaughn.
6. Orange Line: Extend south to Oregon City along the center of SE McLoughlin, grade separate via railroad style crossings at intersections. Extend north to St. Johns with dedicated track along the freight route that borders Swan Island. Would also likely need a tunnel for the final two stations.
7. Purple Line: Central City Loop. Would go between Downtown, the Lloyd District, the Central Eastside, and the South Waterfront on track constructed as part of the other expansions. 

This could be paid for with some combination of a Metro Region income tax, Trimet payroll tax increase, and/or a sales tax on new motor vehicle purchases, along with state and federal grants.",True,False,[],False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,142369,public,self,Portland Needs a Visionary Transportation Plan that Addresses Traffic and Climate Change,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/ecluva/portland_needs_a_visionary_transportation_plan/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{'zhyep92kkh541': {'status': 'failed'}}

Bear with me, my memory is quite poor - this was a basement bar in an older building, I'm almost positive it was on the corner of a block. The place had a relaxed atmosphere with some laidback ""alt"" music playing, but it was not a dive bar - it had more the feel of a classic speakeasy, but it was *not* UnderBar. The bar itself was single- dimensional, I want to say black, and the lighting was subtle, but I seem to remember a good amount of natural light coming from the windows on the side of the room opposite the bar, on two perpendicular sides.
