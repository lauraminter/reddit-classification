* His name is NOT on the lease.

* Talked to my landlord and he says it is up to me to evict him if I want him gone.

He says he cannot afford 2 month's worth of bills in one month (I had to tell his GF because she apparently speaks for him now since she is helping him pay bills). I don't see this as my problem.

I will be giving him a month to catch up on bills, but if he does not pay me within that time, I really want to evict him. How do I go about doing this?

Also, can I legally disallow his GF to be over here? She is super bossy and when I tried to speak to my roommate about the rent/bills situation, she wouldn't even let him talk. She had to be the one to discuss his bills/rent with me and I find this unacceptable.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,How do I evict a roommate not on my lease?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2y3b6g/how_do_i_evict_a_roommate_not_on_my_lease/,,,

She said that she was with ""a non-profit group"" OSPIRG.  I found their website, but it's filled with slimy doublespeak.

I sent her away so that I could read the bill and find out more about it, and she hit me up for monthly donations to her employer.  I'll say it again:  WTF?

I built it for her to try and set up a hackintosh, but after a little while it just wouldn't start up. Worked fine in the first few weeks, but after a period of non use, it just stopped booting. I obviously don't want to take it to geek squad as they would probably be next to useless for something like this. 

I figure someone on this subreddit might have enough knowhow to help me out. I also realize that there needs to be some sort of compensation. I am not too well set up financially. I can offer up some cash for your time, hopefully it's a quick fix. However, if it is a more involved project that would stretch beyond my budget, I am happy to discuss some sort of barter and trade. I am currently leaving a job and will have plenty of free time if you have need of extra manpower on a job.

Anyway, if anyone reading this could help me out, it would be much appreciated. My fiancée would be thrilled to have a working computer again and not have to split time with my laptop.

What I'm looking for: There is a wide range here.  Some things that would be useful are a familiarity with technology, an easygoing personality, and possibly some marketing knowledge/experience.  

Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments, but PM me if you'd like to go further.
