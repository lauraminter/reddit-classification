Tonight it took me 30 minutes to go 300 yards on 205 North because of an accident.  The accident was confined to the shoulder and part of the fast lane and they shut down the whole freeway.  Cars were allowed to go by in a single line consisting of part of the the right lane and the shoulder.

There was plenty of room for 2 lines of cars to get through but no one was doing traffic control.  No one ever does traffic control!  They just stood around looking at shit while people in their cars were losing their minds, because 205 was a parking lot.

If there was some organization and forethought it wouldn't be this bad.  But instead, every cop from within earshot rushes to the scene just so they can park on the freeway and stand around and look at shit.  How about grabbing some cones and a flashlight and help some of these people get by.  Create two lanes of traffic out of the available asphalt please.

I'm new-ish in town and want to explore but my friends here aren't big hikers! Mostly looking for people who would want to go on weekends, probably 4-8 mile hikes of moderate difficulty but we could work up to bigger stuff. Maybe down the road do some smaller 1-2 night backpacking trips. 

If that sounds like fun, let's grab a beer sometime this weekend/next week. 

Anyone who's interested, let's meet at the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne at 3 p.m. Sunday! I'll be wearing a bright green scarf.
