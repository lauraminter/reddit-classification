It got out of hand and we had to get him out of here. He came and retrieved all of his vehicles other than this boat. He says he can't find the title and that we can just ""give it away.""

Well, it's unlicensed, and its not possible to licence it without the title, so someone couldn't legally come and hitch it up and drive off of our lot, so while giving it away sounds nice, it's not very realistic. I see that people post free or not-free boats on craigslist without titles but it seems sketchy. I really don't want to pay to have this lazy asshole's boat towed away.

A bit of a behind-the-scenes look:  over the last few weeks, some personal issues arose that impacted the ability of some of our mods to be as active as they normally are.  Once our IRL dust settled, we talked about adding another mod to the team, because A) the sub is still growing steadily (averaging 40 or so new subscribers per day over the last two months) so we should be expanding the mod team abilities, and B) having an extra set of eyes means that someone can be watching the sub when something crops up that keeps us from being here.

So we had a bit of a modmail discussion about it, and a few names were put forward.  We settled on /u/epicrepairtime due to the fact that he's a very active member of the sub who has been around for quite some time (he'll be celebrating his second cake day in May) and is both well liked and well-respected here.

We all think his attitude and sense of humor will be a good addition to the mod team.  I've personally met the guy at meetups before, and agree fully.

He has an IEP and receives a good deal of support for speech and behavioral issues that we're working on with him. Academically, he's flourishing, and is well above grade level for reading. Math and writing are fine and may be above grade level as well.

I know that you understand where I'm coming from. I don't know very many people who DON'T like the free internet. As a place to be free, it's our most open platform of communication on this PLANET! And if they take that freedom away from people..for some more MONEY, there will be much turmoil, but ultimately we'd be helpless. So we have to fight back against any decision by the FCC and big cable, as is our RIGHT and DUTY to. And if you're not with the people on this, I couldn't call The Oregonian a journalism company, which is BUILT on the freedom of speech, and is assisted by the openness of the internet, to spread your articles across it.


Experts agree that Big Telecom´s Internet Slow Lane plan will kill choice, stifle innovation, and make the Internet more like cable TV. Do you really want that? Do you want to have to subscribe to the Google Package? ONLY 39.99 A MONTH WITH A CONTRACT FOR 4 YEARS IF YOU ACT NOW! And if you don't subscribe, you're out of luck, a basically unusable or unavailable website, all because of your ISP's new power to suck the money out of you and other companies.


Slow lanes on the internet will further marginalize people of color and low-to-middle income Americans who rely on the Internet to tell stories that too often don't make the front page. I'm sure you heard about Ferguson, right? That was ALL OVER the internet for a little while..then people forgot. But if it hadn't had the people's journalism on this free internet, it wouldn't have been known of at all, because of the racist and powerful white police force in Missouri.


President Obama already made the strongest possible statement in support of Net Neutrality, and specifically asked the FCC to reclassify Internet services under Title II of the Communications Act. Now it’s time for the FCC and our Members of Congress to come out in support of the open Internet. www.battleforthenet.org is a good resource to help see what side our congress senate and house members are on, with relevant information and clear formatting to help people take action, and call their state representatives. Wyden, Merkley, Blumenauer, Bonamici, And DeFazio all support an open internet, and we need to voice our support for their decision not to cop out for cash. But representatives Schrader and Walden have been known to be bought out on things like this, and side with Big Cable. Big Cable has it's hands in our Representatives pockets, and we need to let them know that IS NOT OKAY.


Tom Wheeler, Chairman of the FCC, should do the right thing and put an end to this reckless slow lane plan. We've already waited too long for common sense to prevail and to establish clear, enforceable rules to safeguard the open Internet. He's in the grey area right now, and hasn't spoke on either side of the issue, but since he's the one who is going to be pushing the agenda, he needs to be responsible and make the right and proper decision to protect the people's rights.


We need to take control of our own rights, and keep Big Cable from manipulating our representatives like puppets with their money. The FCC needs to make the right decision, and take a stand in this, instead of letting Big Cable walk over them, too. We have all been played for far too long and something must change. Together we can keep our free internet.


Please write an article on this subject, or if you'd like, you can use mine, I don't really mind either way. I just want an ally in this situation, and Oregonians read The Oregonian, so it's a good move on your part. Please push the agenda so we can be sure we can keep our free internet.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,My letter to The Oregonian on The Internet Slow Lane,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2untch/my_letter_to_the_oregonian_on_the_internet_slow/,,,,

I don't mind so much because for me it'll be a once in a lifetime thing, they'll never come to my country, but I know most people won't be willing to pay what they cost me ($200 on a $50 seat) so I'd accept less than that to recover some money, maybe accepting the best offer via PM.

I'm here to let you all know about a newly-minted home growing community located here: [http://www.reddit.com/r/portlandhomegrowers/](http://www.reddit.com/r/portlandhomegrowers/)

Measure 91 which passed last year allows for 4 plants per household, and I know home growing is going to explode here over the next few years so I figured we should get started now! 

The main purpose of the community is to be a place where we can help each other out as we learn to grow. I have personally wanted to start growing for many years now but have been hesitant because of the risks involved. Now that the door is opening I am stoked to begin this journey and get to know this plant more. 

Most importantly, because measure 91 allows for sharing and trading our home grown harvests, we will be able to legally gather to share and trade with each other. 

Lastly, there's not currently a good way to buy/sell/trade equipment outside of craigslist, so this will be a good place for that as well. 

So if you are in Oregon and interested in home growing, come on over and sub. Good things are coming!
