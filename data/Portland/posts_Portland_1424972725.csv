I'm particularly interested in meeting subject experts in long-range planning and forecasting, local geology, climate change, urban and transportation planning, resource management, population trends, and any other relevant topics, as well as anyone interested in creating a vision for our long, long-term future.

My short-term goal is to gather long-range planning and forecasting data to create as detailed and realistic a vision as possible for what life will be like here, and what the effects will be of long-term world trends on life in this area. I want this vision to be engaging and accessible - creating science presentations or art projects to share the likely future of the Portland area with those of us currently living here.  I'd like to also create a web-based timeline of likely events and the effects of long-term trends on the area.

For instance:

- Given the current estimates for sea-level rise, it appears we could see salt water encroaching into the Willamette river in ~150-200 years.

- The Portland Metro area may gain approx 750,000 people in the next 20 years (by 2035) and top the 3-million mark.  If that trend were to continue, we'd be looking at 3 million additional people every 80 years.   Is that realistic?  Sustainable?  What things are likely to affect local population trends?

- We're ""about due"" for a major earthquake (the Cascadia Subduction Quake), and can expect a large earthquake on that scale around every 200-300 years.  How will that impact future residents, and what could Portland do to minimize that impact?

- As the climate warms, we will see less and less snowpack in the Cascades.  Will we reach a point where Mt. Hood won't have snow left on it in the summer?  In the winter?  What impact will these changes have on drinking water for future residents and how will the climate changes impact what plants and ecosystems grow in our forests?

- We're just now finishing building a new bridge - what is it's expected lifetime? What are the expected lifetimes of our current bridges, and how often will they need to be replaced?

- What can we estimate about technology trends on transportation, food production, the electric grid?  Offloading all our data computation onto [orbiting satellites](http://server-sky.com/)?
 
The City of Portland just released a draft plan for the city [between now and 2035](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/65310).  That's a great start, and I know there must be people here forecasting and planning even farther out than that.  I'd like to find those people, figuratively get them all in a room together, gather the data we collectively have, and see what trends we can identify and conclusions we can reach.

This is growing out of my attempts to put some context around these major global trends, like climate change, sea level rise, population trends, and see what these trends mean for the Portland area and people who will be living here - my kids, their kids, etc.  Portland has been here for ~165 years, will it still be here in another 165 years?  300?  500?  Who will be living here then, and what will life be like for them?  I have more questions than answers, and predicting the future is notoriously difficult, but I would like to gather the best answers we have, create a vision of the likely future, and make that vision as accessible as possible to everyone living here now.  Eventually we could funnel this energy and data into having an impact on local government policy decisions, and can work to create the best possible future for the Portland area's future residents.

For those of you who do not know what this is here are the two links for the tournament we will be streaming:  http://www.esl-one.com/csgo/katowice-2015/
http://intelextrememasters.com/season9/worldchampionship/

Basically it is a huge tournament with over 100k in prizes for each game. The games being played are: Counter-Strike Global Offensive, League of Legends, and Starcraft 2. Our streaming event will have each game on a separate TV.

I will be making my rounds through the various Portland nerd havens (comic shops, tabletop shops, Ground Kontrol...etc) hanging flyers and promoting the event within the next two weeks.

The stream will be held at a drinking/eating establishment that serves food and alcohol (it is Vegan and Vegetarian friendly as well).

(edit 1: removed an excess 'is')

How many of you would be interested in this? Would you tell your friends/family/partner? How many people would you bring to the event (if any)?

Some feedback from you fellow gaming nerds would be awesome. Questions and concerns are definitely welcome!

Thank you guys!

I have roommates, but the landlord has not yet added them to the lease, even though they submitted applications and were approved (this was communicated via email).

There seems to have been a misunderstanding when the application was first put in, and the lease was made with only my name on it. Even though I put their names in the application, they hadn't yet applied themselves (I didn't know the process by which they were suppose to apply). Our previous lease overlapped with this one by 1 month so I was not concerned, and agreed to sign the lease with just my name and add the roommates once they finished the applications (they wanted to wait to move anyway).

I have been told for months they'll be added, but recently I have stopped receiving responses to emails on this topic (other emails get answered however).

We are in an untenable, illegal situation and I feel that my only recourse is to break the lease, pay the fee, and find someplace else for us to live. Clearly my roommates need to get on a lease, and I'd rather waste the lease-breaking fee than rent for the rest of the year on a place I don't need. In the past I've had no trouble finding somebody else to take over a lease if I've had to move or that kind of thing, but given the situation I don't find it likely my landlord will be amenable to this option.

TL;DR:
What I'm wondering is: What will the consequences be for me if I break my lease? Will I ever be able to rent a place again? Will my credit be ruined?

Thank you very much for any help/insight you have to offer.


edit:

Lease says the following about breaking: 

&gt;""Lease-Break Fee. In a term tenancy (i.e., not Month-to-Month), if tenant terminates the tenancy prior to the expiration date of the initial term (or any subsequent lease term entered into thereafter), tenant shall remain responsible for giving a 30 day written notice in addition to a cancellation fee of what is equal to 1 and a half months rent.""

I usually take 54/56 into town, and in the past few weeks these buses have been late, as in ritualistically and predictably late.

Hi everyone! A little over a month ago i posted here asking for help in finding an FIV+ cat for my parents to adopt.

Well, they recently found great little dude at the Humane Society of Western Washington. The brought him home on V-Day, and he's been absolutely great. He's about 5 years old, and very friendly, and came with the name Frederick. My parents love him very much and the bond was almost immediate.

Sadly, 2 nights ago, he bolted out the back door and hasn't come home since. He was neutered very recently (still has his male jowels) and so we figure he was still feeling some strong territorial/roaming urges. Although he's been very relaxed ever since they brought him home (slept with my parents from the first night) he's been very vocal and desperate to get outside at night.

My parents are trying to remain hopeful/optimistic, but it's clear they are very worried and would like nothing more than to know he's at least doing okay. 

They have gone through the neighborhood on foot a few times, calling his name, and have seen plenty of cats, but not Fred. We're hopeful that with his exploratory instincts and good weather, he has simply been able to cover a lot of ground.

My mom told me that he escaped once before a day before going missing and returned to the house after about an hour, so perhaps that means he at least has a good idea where they house is, despite only being there a short time.

Anyway, i just figured i'd post here because the weather is nice and people are more out and about. Even just a sighting would make my mom and dad more at ease. You can PM me with any info. :)

A dear friend of mine is a wheelchair user and was using the bathroom at CC Slaughter's this weekend, which for those who haven't been in there, the bathroom is open to all to share and use and is considered a safe space for all. One great thing about CC's is they very much do not tolerate any sexist, homophobic, or otherwise untoward treatment of other humans enjoying their time there. My friend, while using the bathroom, has mentioned to me that a cis-male in the stall next to her offered to assist her while she was trying to pee (which, she gets unusual offers of this sort fairly often, so she responded with a ""no thank you"" through the stall door and resumed her business expecting to have some privacy. The male then said to her ""I could lick it real good for you"" and left shortly after.

She not only felt terrified, violated, and embarassed, but now this safe space that she has gone to for many years, has now become a place where she has to question her safety. In a fucking bathroom. That everyone shares and has the purpose of being a safe space. I am just hoping that 1. if you are the person who said this to my friend you should be ashamed of yourself and please never, ever set foot in that establishment again and 2. keep in mind that our gay bars are especially sacred ground whether you are gay, straight, in between, and so forth. These are areas where people REALLY NEED a safe space to hang out at as opposed to the rest of the bars in the city. And for the love of all that is holy, if you see someone who is in a wheelchair whether they are in the bathroom, opening a door, using a crosswalk, don't ask to assist them unless they ask you for help. 

edit: no surprise to me this is getting down-voted to the ends of the earth, but I was hoping to start a discussion where I wasn't having to defend why people should be treated decently and not feel victimized.
