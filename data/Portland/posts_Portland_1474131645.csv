4262 SE Belmont is one example of development related groundwater contamination in Portland. DEQ, BDS and the developer all dropped the ball on this one. Tank location and decommissioning was a definitive need. All dry cleaning businesses of that era had underground storage tanks for chemicals. 

Do the people who live in this neighborhood understand what happened here? Is it safe to be eating from their gardens in the next year(s), or for their kids to be splashing in the puddles this winter? What about the urban wildlife, flora and exposure to people and or pets?

There is another construction site across the street from this one and less than a block up. It has sat mostly inactive all summer and has craters half full of debris that are basements from demolished homes. If something isn't done, will these craters fill with contaminated groundwater pools over the winter? Does this site have more leaky tanks?

I will be asking these questions and more when I comment. The email to comment on this is in the linked document. Comments are accepted through September 30th.  

Here is a link to a projected residential demolition map for Portland. http://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=583ea16af1c04fb49896a7c088999d4b

Each of the dots on this map has the potential for lack of oversight. Note this map does not include commercial demolition sites, BDS is supposed to develop a map for those, and this map does not include major residential renovations.

It's good to know the details about the demolitions and construction happening in your area. If you see something that doesn't look (or smell!) right, report it to the DEQ immediately.  It appears the scenario above unfolded for quite some time without the neighborhood being notified about the groundwater contamination.

Portland needs to grow, and old buildings have a life span. 

Contaminating our air, soil and groundwater needlessly in the name of growth is NOT necessary.

I know the the traffic is crazy and you are in a hurry and this city's highways were designed for a population less than half of what we have now.  

*Seriously though people*, when you drive you should have a car length or more for every 10mph you are driving.  Your reaction time is *NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THINK IT IS*.  You can't stop as fast as a motorcycle because your car simply weighs more and your brakes are not *that* awesome.

You will get where you are going just about the same time if you leave a few car lengths between you and the car in front of you.  You will get where you are going just fine if you chose your lane based on where you are going and stay there instead of weaving through traffic like a douchnozzle.  In fact if people would slow down and stop this bullshit there would be far fewer traffic jams.  Leave a few minutes earlier if you have to be somewhere at a certain time.

This problem seems to have really taken hold in the last two years.  Chill the fuck out.  Stop in at one of the million freaking pot shops and get stoned if you have to (not that I promote stoned driving, cause that's bullshit too).  Just fucking slow down.  Your car is a deadly weapon not a video game.

1st one was about a year ago for no zone area permit, which I clearly had. Went to court, got it thrown out in pretrial, as the parking enforcement guy had zero photos of the left rear window - you know, where area permits are supposed to be displayed?

Pain in the ass but I just wanted to get it over with.

Just got one the other day for blocking a driveway, which I was not whatsoever, yet the ticket claims I was.

Now, I know that the citing official won't have any legitimate photos of my car blocking the driveway. They will probably want to dismiss in pretrial.

What I want to know is, is there any downside to being offered a dismissal and refusing and having it go before a judge/comissioner?

I would like to put on record that the issuing official must either have acted out of incompetence or malice. It can't be anything else, and I feel that accepting a pretrial dismissal will allow this abuse to continue, contingent not only on our unwillingness to take it to court, but also our willingness to accept pretrial dismissals, of which there were more than a few the first time I went through this.

Anyone try this before? Deny an offer of pretrial dismissal in order to shame the ticketer in front of the court?

And let me be clear - My car was fully sided by full curb and no yellow markings and when viewed from the side had only solid building adjacent. And I've parked in that spot a hundred times.

Also, I once left my car in a loading zone on a Sunday and spaced it and she got towed. I took my lumps because I was in the wrong and I paid over $300 to get her back.

As some of you may know, I've been accepted at the University of Oregon for grad school.  Today I finished moving into my new house, and am now sitting in my new neighborhood bar as I write out this announcement:

Effective immediately, I'm stepping down as a mod of /r/Portland.

This is a common sense decision.  I've recently had difficulty finding the time to moderate due to my work schedule.  Adding in 13 credit hours of grad classes plus living on the wrong side of the 45th parallel means it does this sub and myself no good if I stay on the mod team.  I dislike inactive mods, inactive top mods even less.  Despite entreaties by the mod team for me to stay (aw shucks, guys), it's in everyone's best interests if I step down.

So yeah, there it is.  It feels weird to be stepping down, I've been a mod here for just shy of four years.  1/8th of my life (well, more like 1/10th).  In that time, this sub has grown from 12k subscribers to over 60k.  We're in the top ten for city subs in terms of size, top 15 for all regional subs.  We've dealt with wild weather, mall shootings, the downfall of a governor, water fluoridation, the homeless, bike thefts, drama galore, and rolling squad deep in the Clack.  It has been one HELL of a wild ride, and I want to thank you all for the experience, and specifically the people I've met at meetups who have been so friendly, open, and fun to be around.  I'm not leaving reddit entirely, I'll still hang around this sub and attend meetups whenever I'm in town.

I know some of you are probably dancing happy jigs seeing the head nazi fascist communist censorship-friendly asshole-who-doesn't-let-me-be-an-asshole mod step down.  To you, I say http://i.imgur.com/IdD7rYN.gif.  To the rest of you, I say farewell, I shall see thee upon the morrow.

 * May you miss your bus frequently, but especially when you're already running late.  
 * May you step on Lego with bare feet.  
 * May you get jury duty summons every time you plan to take vacation, and be unable to get out of it.  

 * May you run out of your favorite condiment at the most inconvenient time.  
 * May you get papercuts on your knuckles, right where it takes the longest to heal.  
 * May you spill soda on your favorite pair of shoes.  

 * May your keyboard get cracker crumbs under the keys.
 * May your phone battery run down extra fast.
 * May autocorrect say goofy things when you try to text someone seriously, and serious things when you try to be goofy.  

 * May your most embarrassing childhood picture turn into a popular meme.  
 * May your favorite food start giving you horrible flatulence.  
 * May your coffee beverages be decaf when you need caffeine the most.
