I come to you today because, well, because there is a fantastic museum in Oregon City that needs to get all the attention it deserves. The Museum of the Oregon Territory is centered around the creation of our great state. It covers the Native American tribes in and around Clackamas county, moves into the settlement of the area and then graduates towards the industrial build up of Oregon City and the entire metro area. They offer interesting school tours and activities in case you teachers need something and they always have fascinating talks, almost weekly, and neat fundraisers. Next month in July they are having a Vintage Cocktail Party.

I've lived here for 3 years now, and would like to thank this wonderful city for being what it is. With that out of the way, I'm fat. I'm 30 years old, 5'10 and weigh 350 pounds. All the muscle I once had is covered in fat. I can't take it anymore, and compensating for it with smarts or career accomplishments just feels hollow now. I've been stress eating and ordering out 5-6 times a week and need to change something, else all the success I've garnered in the rest of my life will be for naught. I think yoga would be a good way for  me to start, and at least lose enough weight that I can get back in martial arts or just go to the gym  without risking heart problems. More than that, I think yoga might help me with not just the weight loss, but also the stress that causes the over-eating, as well as some general balance and peace in my life. That said, I feel like the only fat bastard in this town, and don't want to show up to a yoga class full of skinny people that are way better at it than me. I also doubt they will appreciate my grunting and flatulence. Is there a yoga studio that's more geared towards fatasses such as myself where I may find peer support and a program with a pace that pushes me without holding everyone else back? I'm still pretty flexible from back in my Hapkido days, and still have lots of good muscle from my construction days, so I should catch on quickly. Sorry for ranting, but it does help to get this off my chest. I cannot tell you how much I hate being fat and how long I've been in denial. Goddamn, if I get any fatter I won't be able to wipe my own ass. I can't stay awake through a movie and need a c-pap machine to sleep. I can't go to festivals anymore because of it. I can't easily navigate my way through a party or a concert. I hate seeing the look in the eyes of fellow passengers on a plane that get stuck sitting next to me. I hate how much I sweat and how quickly I start to smell after a shower. I hate how moving and bending down feels like a chore. I hate how when I drop something I'm more likely to kick it under a couch. I hate how hard it is to put on socks and shoes. I have a wonderful girl that loves me, I have a daughter that needs me, I have a house I love and a career I enjoy, too much to lose to eating myself to death. Thank you for reading, and I hope to find a place to heal.

After my cat, Luna, tried unsuccessfully to cross Beaverton-Hillsdale HWY during rush-hour this morning, three cars took action and stopped traffic. She was rushed to the nearby vet by my roommate who literally carried her there in his arms. She miraculously had no broken bones and no internal damage. When I went to pick her up and take her home this afternoon, the assistant said that a man had called to see how she was doing. Also, When I arrived at the vet this morning after it happened, I vaguely remember seeing a woman and her son. My roommate later told me they were one of the cars that stopped traffic. 

I am truly amazed that people actually cared. 

I have no way of thanking the people personally, so I decided to send out this note of appreciation on the internets. 

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
