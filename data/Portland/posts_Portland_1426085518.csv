I'd like to start a weekly meetup at a comfy coffee shop/bar/knit shop (suggestions welcome). I'm thinking a weekday evening (not Friday) will probably be best for most people, but we should take a vote.  I will post the days of the week and you vote for what works best for you.

I'm a fairly new, though avid knitter, so don't worry if you're a beginner. All knitters (and crocheters!) are welcome.

Edit: So far Tuesday is the front runner, which works well for me too. I'm thinking we can start next Tuesday. Now we just need a location!

Oh, and what about a time? Is 5:30 reasonable?

Edit #2: It looks like next Tuesday is St. Patrick's day, should we postpone until the 24th? 

Update: Alright, the meetup will be at The Nest on Belmont (in their upstairs lounge area) at 5:30 on Tuesdays. The first meetup will be next Tuesday, March 24th. 

I'll post an [update thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2zr110/update_knitting_meetupstitch_n_bitch_is_set_for/) later this week. I look forward to stitching 'n bitching with you all!

Update #2: **The meetup was a success! Seven of us attended this week, and everyone was very friendly. I think most people plan on returning (as schedules allow). The Nest was very welcoming. The food is apparently not great, but we can bring in outside food (and there's a food cart pod just down the street!).**

It's odd to say, but Portland has been a pretty decent place to survive a brain injury. There is plenty to do to become brain aware this month-- please take a gander at what I've gathered and add to the list if you can! Understanding TBI is the BEST support you can give to anyone in your life that goes through it. 

* The Neuroscience Club at Portland State University (https://www.facebook.com/PDXbrains) always hosts **free** events that are open to the public. **Friday, March 13th at 4pm**, they invited a big group of survivors, speakers, and researchers to visit PSU to raise awareness from many angles (including bike safety) about brain injury: https://www.facebook.com/events/532817613487724/

* OMSI is hosting the OHSU Brain Fair on **Saturday, March 14th from 10am-5pm** (https://www.facebook.com/events/788433654577994) which is also **free** and open to the public.

* OHSU's Brain Awareness Lecture Series (http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/brain/in-community/brain-awareness/lectures-events/2015-lecture-series.cfm) has an event on **May 18th** about concussions. Sure, it's a little late for March, but you can get a 20% discount using the code ""ohsu20"" at checkout. (thanks Neuroscience Club for sharing that code!)

* The Brain Injury Alliance is hosting its 13th annual Brain Injury Conference at the Portland Airport (http://www.biaoregon.org/annualconference.htm) **March 12th-March 14th** but it is also not free. I do believe that Saturday is free for those that are brain injured, though you'd have to choose between the OMSI Brain Fair and the Conference!

* ALSO, a final note, if you bonked your head or just decelerated super fast one time and have noticed some strange symptoms in the months that follow, you are not crazy and should visit BIRRDsong/Brain Injury Connections NW (http://braininjuryconnectionsnw.org/) for free/caring resources that can help you get the help you need. They have been invaluable to me and have helped me get referred to rehabilitation therapy that has improved my quality of life so much!

And that is all I could think of. PDX is a really happenin' place for head injuries. Also wear a helmet on your bike even if you get sweaty and uncomfortable-- for me! At least for this month.

I have lived there for 3 years now and up till now I have had my office dumpster at work that I could toss trash into after hours and it was never an issue.

My rent is very reasonable and it includes my electrical. The place is cute, clean, decently maintained and private. I know that housing law says that if you have a rental you need to provide garbage services, so my question is: Is my rental agreement legit in Multnomah County? Is this worth pushing the issue now that it is no longer convenient for me to dump my own trash?

Does anyone have any expert knowledge on this matter. I would like to look into get trash service for my residence, not get out of the rental agreement or get him in trouble.

(Again, it's a $35 tax) And I have to prove my wife (housewife/SAHM) didn't earn anything by handing over my Federal return. Who came up with this, and how do I make the pain stop? Tempted to just double pay to avoid the hassles... is that the point? Am I stupid? I may be stupid. I'm ok with that, I'd just like to know.

Just for the record, I voted for the tax, I don't hand-wring about any aspect of it other than how they are managing collection. I just want to hand over my $35 (or whatever is correct) easily and get on with life.

I'm curious as to why such opposition? It seems insane to think we have seat belt laws but not bike helmet laws, and given the overall statistics involved with injuries and bicyclists not wearing helmets, why is this even something they oppose?

From the article they allege ""safer streets"" is better to achieve this goal. One cannot support safer streets AND bicycle helmet laws too?

This past Saturday at about 8:30 AM an SUV came speeding through hit a boulder (which shot it into the intersection) then lost control which caused it to go up onto the sidewalk and take out tree. They sped off (very surprised it was running) and got away. About 20 minutes prior there were kids playing outside near the intersection, luckily they were not around otherwise this could have been a fatal incident. The city says the home owners on that section have pay for it to be paved if they want it, and they won't let us block off that section because an emergency vehicle has to be able to get through. The neighbor hood would love to have it closed off for the safety of everyone around and build a little community garden.

(Yes, ass, me, eyes, something something, dull boy I think?)

He called me this morning as I was at work, asking if I had seen his bike. Turns out someone must have climbed onto the balcony, swiped his bike, and threw it off and rode off.
