I called them up, and was sold on 40/40 (down/up). Install day comes, tech leaves, I'm getting 40/4. No biggie at this point, just some bad settings in CL's software, right? Wrong. They don't offer 40/40, and I don't want 40/4. 

The reason I was quick to try CL fiber is because I was assured a 30 day period where I could cancel without penalty. They're reluctant to let me cancel and convince me that some new equipment will be able to get me what I wanted: 40/40. I agree, thinking, of course a new router could help since the one I was given on install day is using pppoe logins which is common in DSL connections; I just got some old equipment, right?! Wrong again. Their tech shows up with a TV box, likely thinking I'm some chump who doesn't understand a TV box can't possibly make my Internet faster. 

I tell the technician that I'm heated, and sorry for how blunt I'm about to be because this isn't his fault, but that if at any point he thinks he won't be able to get me to 40/40, he should leave taking everything he brought with him because I will not have CL service by the end of the day. I have to leave for work, but my partner stays with the tech. She calls me two hours later saying he's been on the phone the whole time trying to get me what I asked for, and overheard the CL personnel on the other end say, ""we don't even offer a 40/40 plan"". I then politely asked the CL tech to leave, at which point he told me he was able to get me up to 40/12 but can't take the equipment. I was told I'd get free shipping labels and all that jazz; fine. 

I call on my lunch break, trying to cancel, again another break lost to CL ""customer service"". The rep assures me he was able to increase my speeds to 40/40; I should have stuck to my guns here, but this is really all I was after. Plus, they wouldn't dare lie to me again, right?! Wrong again. I'm getting 40/25, which is better, but not what I was sold. 

Last call to CL the next day where I tell them I'm not going to get off the phone until my account is canceled and I'm assured the $180 bill I paid up front for installation and first month would be returned. They say the deed is done, and all will be well with the world once again. I packed and shipped the equipment that weekend; I literally couldn't wait to get it out of my house. 

I couldn't believe how happy I was to have a Comcast Cable technician installing cable Internet on my new house. Coming from the Philly area where Comcast is often referred to as the devil, this is dumbfounding; CenturyLink makes Comcast look like Mother Theresa. 

Fast forward to next month: the CL equipment has been returned, and I've got 100/10 from Comcast in my new house; couldn't be happier. Until I get the second month's bill from CL, but that's not all, in another envelope from CL, is a refund check. Probably just sent the bill before the cancelation was processed; I did get the refund check after all, right?! I'm never right... 

I call and get passed around a few times because no one can find my account until I eventually end up talking to someone in, ""the finance department"". She tells me no one else could see my account because of how it was closed, but she can confirm that I have a zero balance, and my equipment was processed. Another hour of my life gone for nothing. 

This same thing happens again: another bill and another call to CL where they confirm I owe nothing and that I can ignore these bills. 

That all took place last summer. Fast forward to today where I receive a bill from a collections agency, saying my delinquent account has been turned over to them! Sooooo, here is my question to you, Portland: 

TLDR: Is CenturyLink scamming people who cancel within their 30 day satisfaction guarantee period, or are they just totally incompetent to a degree that must be criminal? 

And... Does anyone know if there are grounds for filing law suits in any of the above? I called from work a few times, so I have recorded phone calls.

I was enjoying a beer yesterday and watched as a bus was stopped for about 10-15 minutes.  People kept whipping into the oncoming traffic to get around, nearly saw a couple wrecks.  Shitshow level 7/7.

I took one photo from where I was sitting, then went over for a better angle.

http://imgur.com/a/M2Ehl

The lady that parked there was even semi-rude when I told her she was going to get towed.  She'd come back to grab something out of the back, completely ignoring the bus, she just started walking off.  I let her know the bus driver was pissed, she was probably calling a tow truck.  

""Why!?"" she demanded.

""Well, because the bus thinks it can't get through,"" the fuck do I know about it, I'm trying to help these people out on the bus not tell you why you can't park for shit and why the bus driver thinks she can't get through.

She moved it and the cops came by maybe 3 minutes later.  So, you're welcome bitch, I saved your dumb ass from a ticket.

I talked to one of the bartenders, I guess this has been happening all the time since they added the pedestrian crossing island and removed parking without painting the curbs.  Once the car was legit blocking the path of the bus, no way it could have gotten through, but not this time.

I get that it's tough to park, but stop parking illegally.  

Also, I get that the vehicle is parked illegally, but the bus could easily have just made it through.

If you were on that bus, I feel your pain.  Dumbness prevailed that day.

Paul Manson, PSU.  
Wednesday, 08 March 2017, 7:30 pm  
238 Smith Memorial Student Union, PSU  
Today’s political and policy processes are increasingly louder. Traditional sources of information for policy makers are also increasingly diverse. Along with experts and staff scientists, public participatory tools are including perspectives from many communities. More voices and claims on knowledge have joined the debates – making sense of all of these inputs is no simple task. What does this mean for agencies tasked with protecting and managing our shared public resources? As a policy and public administration researcher, Paul Manson has been exploring these questions through several applied and academic research projects on the Oregon coast. The past decade has been seen the development of two new initiatives for managing Oregon’s ocean and coast: the establishment of a marine protected area network known as marine reserves; and the update of the Territorial Sea Plan to accommodate ocean renewable energy development.  
Both of these developments expanded the idea of public involvement to use new technologies of public participatory geographical information systems (PPGIS). In a world where Google Earth and mobile device mapping have made information and visualizations common, there is a shifting expectation about how to participate in decisions for our environment. PPGIS is a suite of techniques, tools, and analytical steps that ask members of the public to share geospatial information about their uses, wishes, and expectations. This talk will share how these PPGIS technologies have been used, and the challenges these tools both face and possibly create. Paul’s talk will explore recent survey research on statewide public opinions on marine management, and share ongoing research on participatory mapping in the development of the Oregon Territorial Sea Plan.
