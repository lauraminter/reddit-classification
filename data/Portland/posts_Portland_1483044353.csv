Let's assume Portland is turning into Northern California. That is, prices are going up, and locals are getting priced out. Much like Silicon Valley 20-30 years ago, for anyone who wasn't a property owner.

Under the assumption that Portland is containing down a path of increased congestion, and reducing quality of live, where is a good place to move to? 

This question is coming from a born and raised Vermonter, who appreciates a small town, and community business. Who also against his will was moved to Southern California as a teenager, and absolutely hates the culture there. I hate driving fast, I hate the materialism, and lack of values, lack of caring, and I hate the insanely high taxes. 

Having spent a year in Portland, it is the best city I have ever seen in the United States. It is just like Vermont, but not as cold, and there are more people in the city proper of Portland than in the entire state of Vermont. The problem with that is the free market. Anyone with half a brain that can see the value in Portland. Anyone who has the means to, can move here, making it a little busier, a litter pricier, and with a little more social isolation, which is typical of large cities.

This is my first DUI and I'm currently going through diversion. I've been placed in diversion with finishing all of my required classes back in September now I am coasting until i finish diversion.  Before going in diversion my attorney spoke to me about staying clear away from any alcohol and drugs. Now the real fuck up happened on Christmas Eve, I went drinking at 9 pm and crashed around 3am, I want to say i had about 6-10 drinks in that time span, woke up the next morning at 10 am, waited an hour to dissipate any alcohol from my breath like drinking water and rinsing my mouth etc.  At 11 am, I went to start my car and it failed on me on the first go, then I proceeded to turn the car off and went back inside to sleep it off.  My IID did lock out at the time but since i turned the car off and waited to start it again there was no need to call LIFE SAFER to unlock my car, I've spoken to my attorney and told them the whole story, they can't tell me anything until the system gets re-calibrated on January 5th and I'm assuming that's when the company will notified the judge with the fail start.  My IID does not have a BAC reader that tells me how much I blew so I don't even know what my BAC was. I am going through the process of getting my IID removed after 6 months since this is my first offense.  My question is what should I be expecting? What are the repercussions of this event? Please any advice is helpful since I feel like I hit rock bottom and cannot climb out of this hole.

Since we got the roof replaced, we decided to install a hood in the kitchen. Had the roofers put in a roof vent while they were doing the install, but need some help installing the hood itself. Need an electrician to get it hard wired and also need ducting through my cabinets through the attic and connect to the new roof vent.

I live here on E Burnside and the city is doing some sort of work out in front, so they've laid down a steel plate in the street.

The apartment is pretty old and now whenever a bus or big truck goes by the whole thing shakes pretty noticeably. So, with the 20 going by regularly, this is starting to drive me totally insane.

I know it is cheaper than calling a wheelchair cab (by far), and can be called on demand rather than a day or more in advanced like most other services, which is a big bonus.

My wife and I got onto 217 north on the Allen exit and saw a little tan miniature poodle mix with the red collar that ran across the street and onto the on-ramp. The two cars ahead of us noticed it and followed as it ran onto 217. Thankfully other people noticed it as it ran across the two or three lanes of traffic near the divider. The two cars ahead of me pulled near the divider behind and beside the dog and slowed down to protect it. It was so terrified that it just kept running. We followed for a minute before passing on the right. I called 911 to have them alert animal control. It looked like traffic came to a standstill just before the Cedar Hills exit and the dog ran across to the other side.
