I went to the landlord training, one of many renter and landlord training offered by Portland Housing Bureau 
https://beta.portland.gov/phb/rental-services/fair-access-renting-fair-rules

They have really tried hard to push out a lot of training opportunities since we only had a few weeks notice to comply. The training was delivered by Christian Bryant from a property management company/ real estate investment company and while Christian had volunteered and been a part of the regulatory process, he is not a lawyer and just a person offering an explanation as he could.

Caveats: I'm just sharing my notes from the class. I'm not an expert. I own a single house that I rent, I'm not a big landlord nor am I an expert. The class was not taught by a lawyer or anyone from PHB, but was very helpful. It was 3 hours and I still felt like I had tons of questions. There were a lot of times people had questions in the class that were answered with ""I don't know"" and ""I'm not sure yet"" and ""That isn't well defined. I guess that will play out in courts"".  
I hope my notes help others:

**72 hour application process**

*The key word here is ""publicly advertised"". So you can advertise your rental and post when the 72 hour opening is for applications. You can speak to potential tenant and even show them the unit, but if they complete an application before the 72 hour window they experience an 8 hr penalty. 

*The time you ""count"" an application is when it is materially complete, meaning all required parts of the application are complete, they have provided all the proof of income and documentation and the screening fee has been received.

*Many questions about how you're supposed to decide which is ""first"" and how to calculate things like the 8 hr penalty (which gets more complicated if your rental is considered an ""accessible"" unit, meaning it is handicap accessible or could be with accommodations). The short answer is the easiest way is to do everything electronically. Ironically the instructor suggested this 72 hr period was supposed to help the lowest income applicants who do not have a computer ""have a chance"" to turn in an application. However, the difficulty in determining which is ""first"" and the record keeping involved if you accept both paper and electronic applications is really worrisome and it appears most people are going to do everything online now just because the record keeping for this will be automatic.

*You have to post on your listing when that 72 hour application window is, but it is up to the applicants to abide by it. If someone completes an application in full before the 72 hr window then are given an 8hr penalty during that window. So if I have someone submit 2 hours before my 72 hr window and then 2 applications 5 hours into my 72 hour window, the applicant that was ""early"" goes to the back of the line. (again this all becomes more complicated if you have an accessible unit) 

*The moment you start publicly advertising that 72 hr begins... but there is no definition of what publicly advertising is.

**Advertising:**
*When you post your ad you have a ton of stuff you now have to include on that listing. You must specify if the unit is accessible (meaning could a person with a wheelchair use most living areas). This does not exclude a house with stairs as a tenant can request (but pay for themselves) a reasonable accommodation such as a ramp or lift. 
 
*You must note when the open application period begins (a minimum of 72 hours later) 

*You must disclose the screening fee amount

*You must disclose your screening criteria. Since this is typically VERY lengthy, the recommendation was to link from your ad to a website or a dropbox file with your full screening criteria.

**Applications:**

*You must provide an opportunity for the application to ""affirm a disability status"" even if your property is not accessible. So now every application has to ask if you have a disability.

*For units that are accessible, there are some calculations to ""favor"" an applicant with a disability. There are conflicting definitions within the Administrative Rule text itself, one part refers to ""disabilities"" and another refers to ""Mobility disability"" so it is totally unclear if this applies to any and all disabilities or just mobility disabilities

*You must provide on the application a list of notices (recommend that you use links, but there are printable notices available) which include:
- notice for applicants right to request a reasonable modification or accommodation
- Portland notice referring where to obtain the PHB Statement of Applicant rights

*On the application you must include a description of the screening criteria and evaluation process

*On the application you must provide the applicant the opportunity to provide supplemental evidence. In other words, they have to have a chance to upload or provide documents for you to consider if they know something bad will come up during your check. These could be really anything.

**Screening fee limits:**
There are not limits on what you can charge on the screening fees. Most landlords will fall under the ""exact cost charged by the company"" or if they use a company and do some of their own screening it will be the cost the company does + 25%

**Proof of identification and screening:**
(This is where it gets zany to me)

*A landlord (LL) may not reject an application because they do not receive a SS#

*So the question is asked, if a certain credit score is required as part of your screening criteria, how do you check that without a SSN? There were no answers. 

*You have to accept anything that a ""reasonable person"" would say identifies a person, including expired ID. It seems crazy to me, as someone else pointed out, that you can't buy beer with expired ID but I'm supposed to let someone live in my property with one. 

The side talk about LL about this was interesting. I think the effect will be that LL will deny people and give them other reasons if they do encounter an application without a SSN

**Income Screening:**
I encourage interested people to read this part themselves, but there are limits now about adults who are listed as financially responsible and ones that are not and the max amount you can verify for income. It also widens the scope of what LL should consider as income. 
Accepting 2x rent and considering all forms of income, not just job income is something I already do so I honestly did not pay as close of attention to this part. 

I did note that in the screening criteria now that when you consider a co-signer, you can only verify their income levels compared to the rent you are charging NOT their debt-to-income ratio. I heard a lot of landlords saying this may cause them to change their policies regarding cosigning in general, and I can't really blame them. 

**Screening criteria and denials:**

*There are two options for screening. There is the city's ""low barrier"" criteria which allows you to deny someone with just a notice of denial with the statement of the low barrier criteria not met. Denial must be within 2 weeks of evaluation. This allows you to move quickly to the next person.

*If you do NOT use the city's low barrier criteria and you have your own custom one (most people do) you must consider the additional supporting evidence, and if you are still denying you must provide a written explanation of why that additional evidence does not negate the results of your screening. and the denial must be issued within 2 weeks of eval.

*The LL is required to offer a change appeal a denial for up to 30 days but you don't have to hold your unit, it just means they can appeal and if approved then any other rentals you have they don't have to go through screening again for the next 3 months.

**all the above fall under screening criteria regulations and violations are liable up to $250 per violation.**

**-------SECURITY DEPOSITS------**
Now this next part is about security deposits. Violations of these rules are INCREDIBLE steep. I'm frankly shocked the city won't give any chance for landlords to make this right or have some scale for the penalties. Violations to what I'm writing below are liable to the tenant for 2x the amount of the security deposit + reasonable attorney fees and costs. That is incredible to me that they won't even let the landlord make something right for an honest mistake.

**Lease:**
*The lease must reflect the name and address of the bank where you are holding security deposit (and last month's rent if applicable)

*You have to keep the accounts completely separate
(I encourage interested people to read more on this, other than making sure I tell my tenant where the address and bank account is I already follow these regulations)

*You must give a tenant a notice of the security deposit rights
There are limits on what you can charge for a security deposit if you also request last month's rent up front. Recommend looking at the brochure but basically the breakdown is if you request last month's rent up front then you can only as a max of 1/2 a month's rent as a security deposit. 

*It mentions nothing about pet deposits. The instructor believed nothing in these rules applied there, but that is untested and unclarified by PHB.

I'm still confused by the ""conditionally approved"" language which says if the LL is accepting a application upon conditional approval an additional security deposit up to half of one month's rent may be required. the tenant can ask that this amount be paid in installments of up to 3 months. I'm not sure what conditionally approved means it just points to Portland City Code 30.01.086 https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/article/737249 but it sounds like I just say ""you're approved on the condition you give me another 1/2 months of security deposit"" and then require that over the next three months? I'm unclear and anyone with more insight I'd love to hear your thoughts

**Condition Reports:**
*Tenant has 7 days after move in to complete and submit a condition report

*if not completed the LL has 17 days after move in to complete and submit

*it is emphasized LOTS OF PICTURES should be used in documentation

*if there is a dispute on the condition report, then they can get 3rd part validation...There is no business model or profession for doing this 3rd party validation so not really sure who you're supposed to get to do that. Probably not your uncle, but beyond that its unclear

*Any repair or replacement of anything in the house the LL must provide the tenant with an updated condition report

*The lease must include an itemized report describing the condition, age of fixtures, appliances, equipment and personal property

*Within 1 week after move out the LL has to conduct a walk through to document damage beyond wear and tear

*The tenant must be notified about the walk through date and time with at least 24 hour notice, and they have the right to be there during the walk through (which is honestly a safety concern for some people)

*The landlord (LL) can only charge for damage beyond normal wear and tear, defined by ""damaged caused by the tenant's actions or inaction""

*To charge for that damage, the LL must use the depreciation schedule published by [PHB here](https://beta.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2020-01/notice-30.01.087.c.1-depreciation-schedule.pdf)

Everyone noticed that the deprecation schedule and what you can charge is based off what you paid for the item, not the cost to replace it. That can be a big difference on larger ticket items. A lot of people, myself included, were concerned about the increase in documentation and overall financial risks that this particular change brings.

**Rental payment history**
*If you receive a request from a tenant or you send a termination notice, you must provide rent payment history covering up to the last 2 years. 

(it seems zany to me that if you are a day late with this you can be charge 2X security deposit + attorney fees + costs!)



So that is my notes! There were TONS of questions asked in the class. A lot of chatter between landlords and some angry people trying to figure out how to comply within such short notice. 

Some other good advice I heard:
Since you cannot give preference in applications if one person applies 1st and says ""I can move in a month from now"" but the third person says ""I can move in three days from now"" it is best to develop a policy and say in your add ""move in must occur within 2 weeks of approval"" under your screening criteria.

You just load up designated kitchen trash can sized bags full of empties, drop them off and get paid about a week later. Hours are either 8AM to 8PM; or 7AM-10PM depending on spots.

People have had bad experience and getting screwed over in the past, but they've been better recently and they resolve it more agreeably these days.

I'm making this PSA, because I still see bottle return related posts here that discuss returning containers by hand one by one. So, this suggests there are still quite a few people unaware of the bag and drop option. Not wanting to waste tens of minutes returning bottles is the reason for many people who toss their empties into the curbside bins. More awareness of this easy way means less refundable containers getting thrown to the curb.

Looking for a little advice for a friend. 

At an intersection with green light, but having to yield to oncoming traffic to turn left.

The back of their vehicle was in the crosswalk but the front was beyond it into the intersection. At the end of the light cycle the car in front of her (fully in the intersection) turned left, and they followed behind it. In the middle of their turn the light turned red.

It might be cut and dry violation on that. 

But what's the reg if you're partially in the intersection? Or say even fully? If you have a line of traffic behind you, you can't safely back up. And to sit will greatly impede traffic.

Howdy!  We just had our first grandbaby (I'm in love❤️) and I’m looking for gainful employment so I can join my wife who moved up a few months ago.  We really don't know anyone here yet aside from family so my local professional network is pretty thin.  I'm a retired Marine logistics officer, have extensive background in supply chain/logistics, organizational leadership and ""procurementy"" kinds of work.  I'm on all the job boards and realize Reddit isn't the first choice for this stuff but I'm pulling out all stops to make this happens.  Just trying to grow the network as much as possible and I'm in town through tomorrow so if anyone would like a glimpse of my resume or if you have any helpful insight feel free to DM me.

Just today I went to the bathroom in Cramer during class and based on loud grunt/moans and the trash bags visible under the stall, there definitely was a homeless man jerking off in the stall. 

About a week ago during the day there was a guy in the park blocks between campus buildings who lifted up his coat, his pants around his knees and his dick was fully out and visible. He was just walking around like this.

The library bathrooms have been especially bad recently, either entirely covered by piss or with homeless camping out sometimes in twos in the stall. Usually arguing incoherently.

At this point I'm not shocked by any of this but I just don't understand where my tuition money goes if it can't keep random grown men from jerking off in school bathrooms on a Thursday, or from walking around with their dicks out in our quad. Enforce the laws, keep this stuff off our campus please!

Don't even get me started on Parking Structure 3...

We already have keycard access points on all the buildings tied to our ID's, why not make them active all the time. There is no reason for homeless people to be in Cramer, Lincoln, Shattuck, the EB, or any university classroom building.

So no case number because of that.

The car's license plate was ""XMM 083"" if this is your mustang and you want photos of the thief driving it, as well as damage to the driver door where they pried it open, I have those for you, not sure about the rules of posting them here though so I won't.

I only saw this happen because I was driving around looking for my truck that was stolen a few days ago.

I’ve got an extra ticket for the Harry Potter, Goblet of Fire Symphony this Saturday, Feb 29th at 2 PM. 

My mom can’t make it, but I’m still going. The tickets were kinda pricey, but I’ll give it to you for like a 1/3 of the price. I don’t want it to go to waste. I’m at work rn, so I don’t remember the exact price or seating location, but I’ll update when I’m home!

I am local to Portland and record on site so if you are or know of a business that would enjoy being on the show let me know. I can also record via Skype if need be. 

Also, I’m new to podcasting in general and would love input on format, quality etc
