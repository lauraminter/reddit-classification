My Fiance and I are planning on getting married on March 28th, just having a very small, informal ceremony in our back yard with just our immediate family. Partly due to cost, partly stress, and partly a bunch of other reasons. We had planned on having a friend officiate the wedding, but he actually ended up needing to be out of town that weekend, so that fell through. Basically, at this point, all we are looking for is someone to officiate the wedding, sign the paperwork, and have that be that. 

As for location, we are in the inner SE part of Portland, right off of Powell, closer to the river than 205 (of course, for privacy concerns we will leave it at that for now and give a specific location later). Compensation can certainly be discussed, but we were hoping to keep it under $100. If anyone here would be willing to do this for us or know of someone that can, anything would be of help and would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Also, we're both fairly nerdy, non-religious people; we both love Game of Thrones, video games (she especially loves the Sims games), so we don't really need anything particularly religious or formal.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Help!
