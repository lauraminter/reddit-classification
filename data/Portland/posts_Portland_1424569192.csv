I attended Heald college Portland back in 2005-2007. During this time they had something happen during my enrollment. The school started shutting down and laying off our teachers. The morale shot down to a mere depression at the school and they had math/english teachers teaching/learning Network classes. The whole thing just straight up sucked. And me being one of those people that needs positive vibes around me went into a ""I don't care.' Attitude. I wish i didn't but it happened. I felt that going to the school was useless and my learning plummeted to an all time low. Then I was offered to drop and take a diploma instead of a Degree because they were not sure if they could offer me my remaining classes due to shutting down. so I took it.  I graduated with a FRICKEN diploma. I was never able to get a job in my field and they never helped me with job placement like they stated they would have when I enrolled. I hated the whole experience. struggling from job to job and having kids I never could afford to pay my students loans $24K for a Diploma that is useless. So my questions to you Reddit is ""Would a lawyer be able to get my loans Waved or dismissed due to a ""Bad experience/USELESS diploma?"" Is there anyone else in the same boat as I? I am currently thinking about going back to get my degree. So I went to Heald College web site since It reopened by the air port. And what do I see on the site a Fricken waver to tell people that the school might be sold and it states they might now be able to complete your selected courses...

He is eager to please his human, adapts well to new environments and new people, is an amazing snuggle buddy, and plays fetch like a pro.

He knows a lot of basic commands like sit, stay, chill (lay down), off, drop it, leave it, sit pretty. When told, he sits looking at his human waiting patiently for meals and won't eat the food set out before him until given the ok. He has no food or toy aggression/possessiveness.

No human aggression. He does not currently live with children but has been around infants and toddlers at a daycare facility and young children at a preschool.

He is unpredictably dog aggressive. He will react aggressively with some dogs at the park, especially if a dog tries to hump him. The reason he needs a new home is because he has twice seriously injured the 8lb dog he lives with.

Bagheera is one of the most amazing dogs I have ever known and it breaks my heart to abandon him, but he needs more than what I can offer. In addition to a lifestyle in which he can be in a human-only home, he will ideally receive more behavioral training to work on his aggression.

When he joined our family he came with a problem in his hip, which we have gotten x-rayed but not yet dealt with. He walks and runs fine, but will avoid putting too much weight on that leg, which implies it is uncomfortable. I do think the pain in his hip might play into his dog-aggression. It is imperative that you be able to get him surgery or another vet approved legitimate fix for the problem.

He is NOT a fighting dog and should you attempt to use him as such legal actions will be taken against you. If you are trying to fool someone into giving you a pitty for fighting don't waste your time here.

He needs a home with a fenced yard. Preferably adults only, possibly children over 10 years. No infants, just to air on the side of caution. No other animals in the home.

Bagheera is turning 4 years old this year, 57lbs, neutered, and up to date on his shots.

There is a rehoming fee and it is 100% refundable with receipt of surgery/other vet approved appropriate action taken to deal with his hip.

If after reading this you think you are capable of offering this animal the greatest home for the rest of his life, shoot me a message! Please include a bit about yourself, who is in your home, your general lifestyle, general work schedule, how much time you could spend with Bagheera, what experience you have with dogs, and any other relevant information. Replies lacking adequate information will be ignored.

Thanks!

A few nights ago, I skated Zoobomb with a couple of friends.  We've done this run many times before. We were on our second run, about 11 p.m., when a cop car appeared from a side street and pulled us over.  He gave us all tickets for a total of $345 each, $115 for skating after 10 p.m., $115 for not having front &amp; rear lights, and $115 for running a stop sign.  The cop even had us on video, and told me he recognized me from a previous video shot by a local resident's security camera.  Here's what I learned after talking to him.  First, using your slide pucks really gets the locals calling the cops, because of the noise.  Second, there are cameras at the MAX stations and on the trains, and the operators now are calling the cops when they see skaters get on at Goose Hollow and get off at the Zoo.  So the cops have plenty of warning that you're coming down the hill, which makes it easy to nail you.  Third, there's been a big jump in skate traffic on Zoobomb lately, and the neighbors are calling the cops and the cops are tired of it, so they're turning out in force, especially after 10 pm.

Once a week a car drives through my neighborhood early in the morning and tosses a bag full of garbage on my driveway. They do the same thing to my neighbors as well. Sometimes the bag gets soaked by the rain and the garbage starts to disintegrate all over my driveway. I pick it up and throw it in my garbage can, but I shouldn't have to; Garbage should not be thrown on my property in the first place.

A while back I noticed that these guys actually have the balls to put the name of their organization and a phone number on the bag of garbage. I called this phone number and told them to stop. They said they would stop, and for one week the bag of garbage was absent, but the next week it was back again.

I'm guessing this organization has some connections in local government, because if I were to throw trash on people's yards with my name and phone number displayed prominently, and continue to do so after being asked to stop, I would end up with some large fines for littering. 

I looked on Google, which, if you aren't aware, is this place where people get information about the world around them, and it seems that a number of other people are reporting similar occurrences  all over the Portland Metro area. I did some more digging and found that people once paid for these bags to be thrown on their lawns and driveways. 

Curious, I opened one of these bags and examined the contents. Someone had written about all the events that happened the previous few days, things that I had already read about online, shoved it in a bag, and then tossed it on my driveway. Very disturbing. Makes you wonder what is going on in their minds.

I want to climb mt St. Helens this year. I have my permits for a weekend in May. Last year I attempted the summit but has to turn around about halfway through because I was just punching through the snow on each step up to my thigh. People had no issue with snow shoes. Defeated I went home. So this year year, even with the terrible lack of snow, I still want to be prepared. I tried to order a rental pair of snow shoes from REI but apparently they stop loaning them out in march so rental snow shoes are out of the question. The guy suggested renting crampons instead (which are available) of snow shoes and would help in not falling through the snow. I don't know if it's legit advice or not. Crampons are roughly the same footprint as your boot so I wouldn't think it would help. But I am also not experienced in that area so I may be wrong. Obviously I'm not dealing with ice, strictly snow.

So my question is would crampons be an acceptable replacement instead of snow shoes to prevent falling into deep snow on each step?

I predict the snow will be little to possibly none, but I would really hate to turn around for the exact same reason.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,Strange question to all you local mountaineers.
