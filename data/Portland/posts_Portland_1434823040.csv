Firstly, I'm a biker and motorist in equal measure. I realize there are fools and saints on both sides.


Each time I see the aftermath of these collisions, we get a full-on firetruck with 4 firemen, a cop car with one or two cops, and an ambulance with 3 EMTs.

I understand and appreciate they would always assume the worst and respond in-kind, but...

Why a fire-engine? (I know they are EMTs too, but the ambulance is already there)

Why do all response vehicles end up in the most ridiculous parking positions, likely to cause another accident.
  Mostly, they stop in the junction blocking everybody. Today, we have no cars parked anywhere due to tree cutting. Plenty of places to pull in.

Why do all vehicles keep their engines running for 15+ mins.

I heard the girl call in the accident, she said there was an accident, no one seriously injured, etc. They knew the situation.

I can understand the cop, in-case there's an argument, and I get the ambulance for possible medical aid.


Friday evening moan over...


Whats the legal situation when a car up ahead is indicating to show they are about to cross the bike lane to turn off the road, and a bike comes from behind the car and smacks into the side of it as its turning? 
Putting it in terms of a car changing lanes, isnt the car behind at fault if they hit the (indicating) car in-front as they change lanes?

However, his lease is up mid-July, and my lease is not up until the end of September. We decided a few months ago that the plan would be for him to move into my apartment until my lease is over, and then we would find a bigger place together.

I **specifically** checked my lease before I signed it to make sure it would allow for this. My lease says that I could add a tenant or sublease (a good backup) with permission from my landlord. There are no other restrictions or details provided. 

So, with 30+ days notice, I asked my landlord for permission for my boyfriend to move in with me for 2 months until my lease is up. I said that he would complete a background screening for $40, pay a key deposit, and get renters' insurance, and that I would remain 100% responsible for the rent and damages according to my lease.

My landlord just wrote me back to me and said that he could move in **if** we pay $300 more a month and if we move out in early September (rather than September 30). She wrote ""the unit is really designed for one person."" What?!

My apartment is a 1-bedroom, 750 square foot apartment on Division &amp; 30-something (not one of the new buildings; a small older building). When I came to the open house, there were many couples there looking at this unit. The apartment across the hall is smaller than mine and is occupied by a couple. Oregon occupancy rules says 2 people can occupy 1 bedroom.

In fairness, I pay $1050 a month including utilities (heat, water and electricity). However, adding another person could not possibly warrant $300 a month (especially in the summer when we have no a/c). Had my boyfriend signed my lease with me when I did, we would've paid $1050 total. That's what the apartment was advertised for, regardless if it was one or two people signing the lease.

Furthermore, moving out early? I asked her if I could sublease a few months ago (so my boyfriend could avoid the move-in-temporarily-with-me-before-we-move-again thing) and she said ""No. But you can break your lease for $2500."" But now I have to leave early?

Please let me know if I have a leg to stand on here. Is this fair or legal (I am trying to read the ORS but I don't see anything helpful there yet)? How should I respond?

If I have no choice, I will suck it up and pay and get out early. But I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I have been a good and problem-free tenant; never late on rent, always friendly, no noise, and my apartment is in immaculate condition. This doesn't seem fair - surely there are reasonable protections for people who's family/living situation changes?

However, I didn't grow up HERE -- I moved to Oregon in the late 90s (Eugene specifically), and didn't move to Portland until around 2001.  I'm extremely curious to hear people's impressions of the general atmosphere of Portland from the 70s and 80s, as I had no extensive experience of it prior to the year 2001. 

The city has changed rather dramatically even since 2001.  When I moved here, Hawthorne and perhaps NW 21st/23rd were the only neighborhoods exhibiting the ""urban village"" phenomenon -- you know, the 10-15 block strip full of bars, cafes, restaurants and shops, which people stroll along.  There might have been about two blocks of this type of thing on Belmont and Clinton, but that was it -- of course it has since popped up on 28th, Williams, Missisippi, Division, Stark in Montevilla, etc.  Most bars and nightlife options in the early 2000s were rather scattered and not concentrated along these stretches.  However, I've heard that in the 80s, there was no concentration of shops and bars on Hawthorne or the NW area.  I've been told that inner SE and NW were a bit run down and industrial, and although they might have featured a handful of hippy organic businesses and cafes, it consisted of predominantly dive bars, diners, and Plaid Pantry's, and that shows were predominantly held in basements or abandoned warehouses.  I've been told there were way more hippies, punk rockers, metalheads, goths and skinheads (subcultures that are significantly smaller today), and a lot of blue collar folks, junkies, and immigrants from southeast Asia (who now live much further out in the 100s).  I've also heard that there used to be street prostitution in the Hollywood neighborhood on Sandy and even in NW.  Portland was very recently an industrial city, as is evidenced by the warehouses everywhere (some of which have been converted into pubs), and it sounds like the atmosphere has been completely transformed.  It sounds like everything was inexpensive, gritty, and somewhat dicey.  The 80s in general were more dangerous - back then, there was a real danger of having your head stomped in at a metal show, whereas metal shows today are some of the safest places in the world.  At any rate, I'd be very interested in hearing any more details from those who experienced the city at the time, particularly in regard to specific neighborhoods.",False,Portland,t5_2qi2i,self,What was Portland like in the 1970s and 1980s?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3agju5/what_was_portland_like_in_the_1970s_and_1980s/,,,,,,,1434760747.0

I was just hoping to connect with other RC plane enthusiasts in the area for flight location suggestions, advice, etc. Maybe get an informal club going?

Pretty new to the hobby, and have built a few of the simpler flite test planes with their speed kits. Now I'm looking to start cutting out plans on my own. I'm interested to connect with any and all types of plane flyers, though.

A few of my nearest and dearest work at this shithole of a company. What makes it such a terrible place? I'll list out a few points. Know that there are far more points than this, but these are the first that come to mind:

1) Manager of a department makes homophobic and highly inappropriate sexual commentary to one of his staffers. Strangely, the staffer is no longer there, but that manager is - in a less-impressive position, but still on the payroll. 

2) Woman reports harassment to HR. Woman suddenly is no longer employed by the company. 

3) Man reports harassment, after repeatedly telling his supervisor that she is making him uncomfortable. Man finally quits, as HR has done nothing. 

The list goes on - I wish I could say these were the most heinous of the going-ons in this company, but they're not. Furthermore, the fact that this company is a complete shithole is a pretty open secret in the industry which it resides... But no one seems to be willing to say/do anything about it.

A couple of my people who work there have done everything in their power to make it a better place - but they're underlings, bottom of the chain of authority - and have not a whole lot of power. They're all looking for new jobs, but that takes time. 

So my questions to you, as the general public:
1) What would you do if you worked there (besides the obvious, get the hell out)? 

2) Do you think a public-shaming/media campaign would be of any use?
2b) Do you think that media would even care - say, Portland Mercury or Willamette Week?

I've had the same car insurance for like 3 years (Farmers) now and have had to contact them a hand full of times for questions and every time it took them many days to get back to me or I had to repeatedly call them back also I just got my motorcycles license and bought a bike but every time I call to add it to my policy my agent isn't available and nobody else can seem to help me.

 So I've decided to start looking around. Where I used to live I had a nice local agent that was connected to a larger firm but they always seemed on top of it, just wondering if anybody can recommend any agent or agency that they have had good luck with?
