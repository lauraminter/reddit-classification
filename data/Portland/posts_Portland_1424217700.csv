Depending on who shows up, the structure we are planning is (1) everyone votes on which game will be the Championship Game, and that game is set aside; (2) 3-5 games of pool play (grab somebody and grab a game and play it out) to establish a record history until we get a top 8 people; (3) go into an 8-4-2 bracket up to the Championship Game.

We have a Grand Prize now (promised anyway): a new edition of Quarto, published by Gigamic and furnished by Back Alley Traders.  And probably a gold trucker hat. 

That's it, no money, just infinite glory.  And beer.

Below I list games we own.  Don't worry if you aren't familiar with many.  Honestly we aren't either.  Often need a rules refresher when we get out some of the more obscure games.  Maybe you have a new one you want to bring out.  Looking forward to it!

We have a small group that meets weekly, this week we are meeting Thursday at Lucky Lab SE if you wanted to check out some games in advance.  We are not affiliated with the meetup.com group, but that's their night there too.  This week we are focusing on GIPF project games it looks like.

I'm hoping someone walking past the area today sees this and wouldn't mind a quick pic for me?  It'd make me happy and I'd consider it a real treat and a late birthday present :-)

Bill does depend on passing of a constitutional amendment, which the people will have to pass in Nov. 2016.  

Not sure what the progressives think over here, but I don't think getting rid of the right to privacy is very ""progressive"".  I worry more about the abuse of police searches (I.E., baseball bats, utility knifes, wrenches could all be misinterpreted as ""weapons"") than the few lives that are saved from these checkpoints (which are easily bypassed).

Safeway, Fred Meyer, doesn't matter. Dogs in a goddamn food store. Today I was in line at the pharmacy at the back of Safeway and a guy walked by with the cutest, fluffiest dog I've ever seen. Some kind of small collie, maybe. Great, except I'm highly allergic and as it brushed by me I started getting hives on my leg. Then I watched as the guy went to look at the meat and the fucking dog STUCK HIS NOSE INTO THE MEAT PACKAGES. I yelled out ""HEY,"" and the guy looked at me, then looked down, and yanked the leash to pull his dog's nose out of the freezer. You know, as if that made everything better cause the dog snot was only in the fresh meat for 15 seconds instead of 20. 

So I'm standing there, incredulous, and the dog is about to stick his nose in the meat AGAIN, but wouldn't you know it, he gets distracted. By what? ANOTHER FUCKING DOG WALKING BY. 

I'm watching in disbelief as two dogs start sniffing each other's asses three feet from the fresh meat. I was thinking of saying something, but I had been in line for ten minutes already and I was up next. The dogs and their idiot owners moved on, I finished my task, then I went to talk to the manager.

""Hi,"" I said. ""Correct me if I'm wrong, and I might be crazy here, but there's no way it can be legal for people to bring dogs into a place that sells food like this, right?"" And you know what the manager said? ""It's not legal, but we can't really do anything about it."" ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""Well,"" he continued, ""we can only ask them if it's a service dog, and if they say yes, we have to leave them alone. There's nothing else we are allowed to do."" So I told him what happened and added, ""There's no way a miniature collie is a service dog. And his nose was in the meat. There's nothing you can do about that?"" ""No.""  

What the fuck. I walked home, popped an allergy pill and washed my leg, and now I'm sitting here in disbelief because a) morons seem to not realize that bringing your dog into a place with open food for sale is a bad idea, and b) it's ""illegal"" but can't be stopped.
